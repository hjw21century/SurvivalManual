  <blockquote>
    <p>The threat from animals is less than from other parts of the environment.
    However, common sense tells you to avoid encounters with lions, bears, and
    other large or dangerous animals. You should also avoid large grazing
    animals with horns, hooves, and great weight. Move carefully through their
    environment. Caution may prevent unexpected meetings. Do not attract large
    predators by leaving food lying around your camp. Carefully survey the scene
    before entering water or forests.</p>
    <p>Smaller animals actually present more of a threat to you than large
    animals. To compensate for their size, nature has given many small animals
    weapons such as fangs and stingers to defend themselves. Each year, a few
    people are bitten by sharks, mauled by alligators, and attacked by bears.
    Most of these incidents were in some way the victim's fault. However, each
    year more victims die from bites by relatively small venomous snakes than by
    large dangerous animals. Even more victims die from allergic reactions to
    bee stings. These smaller animals are the ones you are more likely to meet
    as you unwittingly move into their habitat, or they slip into your
    environment unnoticed.</p>
    <p>Keeping a level head and an awareness of your surroundings will keep you
    alive if you use a few simple safety procedures. Do not let curiosity and
    carelessness kill or injure you.</p>

<h3><a name="par1">INSECTS AND ARACHNIDS</a></h3>
<p>11-1. Insects, except centipedes and millipedes, have six legs; arachnids
have eight. All these small creatures become pests when they bite, sting, or
irritate you.</p>
<p>11-2. Although their venom can be quite painful, bee, wasp, and hornet stings
rarely kill a person who is not allergic to that particular toxin. Even the most
dangerous spiders rarely kill, and the effects of tick-borne diseases are very
slow-acting. However, in all cases, avoidance is the best defense. In
environments known to have spiders and scorpions, check your footgear and
clothing every morning. Also check your bedding and shelter. Use care when
turning over rocks and logs. See <a href="survival://d.htm">Appendix
D</a> for examples of dangerous insects and arachnids.</p>
<p><b>SCORPIONS</b></p>
<p>11-3. You find scorpions (<i>Buthotus</i> species) in deserts, jungles, and
forests of tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate areas of the world. They
are mostly nocturnal. Desert scorpions range from below sea level in Death
Valley to elevations as high as 3,600 meters (12,000 feet) in the Andes.
Typically brown or black in moist areas, they may be yellow or light green in
the desert. Their average size is about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch). However, there
are 20-centimeter (8-inch) giants in the jungles of Central America, New Guinea,
and southern Africa. Fatalities from scorpion stings are rare, but do occur with
children, the elderly, and ill persons. Scorpions resemble small lobsters with
raised, jointed tails bearing a stinger in the tip. Nature mimics the scorpions
with whip scorpions or vinegarroons. These are harmless and have a tail like a
wire or whip, rather than the jointed tail and stinger of true scorpions.</p>
<p><b>SPIDERS</b></p>
<p>11-4. The brown recluse, or fiddleback spider, of North America (<i>Loxosceles
reclusa</i>) is recognized by a prominent violin-shaped light spot on the back
of its body. As its name suggests, this spider likes to hide in dark places.
Though its bite is rarely fatal, it can cause excessive tissue degeneration
around the wound, leading to amputation of the digits if left untreated.</p>
<p>11-5. Members of the widow family (<i>Latrodectus </i>species) may be found
worldwide, though the black widow of North America is perhaps the most
well-known. Found in warmer areas of the world, the widows are small, dark
spiders with often hourglass-shaped white, red, or orange spots on their
abdomens.</p>
<p>11-6. Funnelwebs (<i>Atrax</i> species) are large, gray or brown Australian
spiders. Chunky, with short legs, they are able to move easily up and down the
cone-shaped webs from which they get their name. The local populace considers
them deadly. Avoid them as they move about, usually at night, in search of prey.
Symptoms of their bite are similar to those of the widow's—severe pain
accompanied by sweating and shivering, weakness, and disabling episodes that can
last a week.</p>
<p>11-7. Tarantulas are large, hairy spiders (<i>Theraphosidae</i> and <i>Lycosa</i>
species) best known because they are often sold in pet stores. There is one
species in Europe, but most come from tropical America. Some South American
species do inject a dangerous toxin, but most simply produce a painful bite.
Some tarantulas can be as large as a dinner plate. They all have large fangs for
capturing food such as birds, mice, and lizards. If bitten by a tarantula, pain
and bleeding are certain, and infection is likely.</p>
<p><b>CENTIPEDES AND MILLIPEDES</b></p>
<p>11-8. Centipedes and millipedes are mostly small and harmless, although some
tropical and desert species may reach 25 centimeters (10 inches). A few
varieties of centipedes have a poisonous bite, but infection is the greatest
danger, as their sharp claws dig in and puncture the skin. To prevent skin
punctures, brush them off in the direction they are traveling.</p>
<p><b>BEES, WASPS, AND HORNETS</b></p>
<p>11-9. Bees, wasps, and hornets come in many varieties and have a wide
diversity of habits and habitats. You recognize bees by their hairy and usually
thick body, while the wasps, hornets, and yellow jackets have more slender,
nearly hairless bodies. Some bees, such as honeybees, live in colonies. They may
be either domesticated or living wild in caves or hollow trees. You may find
other bees, such as carpenter bees, in individual nest holes in wood or in the
ground like bumblebees. The main danger from bees is the barbed stinger located
on their abdomens. When a bee stings you, it rips its stinger out of its abdomen
along with the venom sac, and dies. Except for killer bees, most bees tend to be
more docile than wasps, hornets, and yellow jackets, which have smooth stingers
and are capable of repeated attacks.</p>
<p>11-10. Avoidance is the best tactic for self-protection. Watch out for
flowers or fruit where bees may be feeding. Be careful of meat-eating yellow
jackets when cleaning fish or game. The average person has a relatively minor
and temporary reaction to bee stings and recovers in a couple of hours when the
pain and headache go away. Those who are allergic to bee venom have severe
reactions including anaphylactic shock, coma, and death. If antihistamine
medicine is not available and you cannot find a substitute, an allergy sufferer
in a survival situation is in grave danger.</p>
<p><b>TICKS</b></p>
<p>11-11. Ticks are common in the tropics and temperate regions. They are
familiar to most of us. Ticks are small, round arachnids. They can have either a
soft or hard body. Ticks require a blood host to survive and reproduce. This
makes them dangerous because they spread diseases like Lyme disease, Rocky
Mountain spotted fever, encephalitis, and others that can ultimately be
disabling or fatal. There is little you can do to treat these diseases once they
are contracted, but time is your ally since it takes at least 6 hours of
attachment to the host for the tick to transmit the disease organisms. Thus, you
have time to thoroughly inspect your body for their presence. Beware of ticks
when passing through the thick vegetation they cling to, when cleaning host
animals for food, and when gathering natural materials to construct a shelter.
Always use insect repellents, if possible.</p>
<h3><a name="par2">LEECHES</a></h3>
<p>11-12. Leeches are bloodsucking creatures with a wormlike appearance. You
find them in the tropics and in temperate zones. You will certainly encounter
them when swimming in infested waters or making expedient water crossings. You
can find them when passing through swampy, tropical vegetation and bogs. You can
also find them while cleaning food animals, such as turtles, found in fresh
water. Leeches can crawl into small openings; therefore, avoid camping in their
habitats when possible. Keep your trousers tucked in your boots. Check yourself
frequently for leeches. Swallowed or eaten, leeches can be a great hazard. It is
therefore essential to treat water from questionable sources by boiling or using
chemical water treatments. Survivors have developed severe infections from
wounds inside the throat or nose when sores from swallowed leeches became
infected.</p>
<h3><a name="par3">BATS</a></h3>
<p>11-13. Despite the legends, bats (<i>Desmodus</i> species) are a relatively
small hazard to you. There are many bat varieties worldwide, but you find the
true vampire bats only in Central and South America. They are small, agile
fliers that land on their sleeping victims, mostly cows and horses, to lap a
blood meal after biting their victim. Their saliva contains an anticoagulant
that keeps the blood slowly flowing while they feed. All bats are considered to
carry rabies. Any physical contact is considered to be a rabies risk. They can
carry other diseases and infections and will bite readily when handled. However,
taking shelter in a cave occupied by bats presents the much greater hazard of
inhaling powdered bat dung, or guano. Bat dung carries many organisms that can
cause diseases. Eating thoroughly cooked flying foxes or other bats presents no
danger from rabies and other diseases, but again, the emphasis is on thorough
cooking.</p>
<h3><a name="par4">VENOMOUS SNAKES</a></h3>
<p>11-14. There are no infallible rules for expedient identification of venomous
snakes in the field, because the guidelines all require close observation or
manipulation of the snake's body. The best strategy is to leave all snakes
alone. Where snakes are plentiful and venomous species are present, the risk of
their bites negates their food value. Apply the following safety rules when
traveling in areas where there are venomous snakes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Walk carefully and watch where you step. Step onto logs rather than over
    them in a survival situation. During evasion, always step over or go around
    logs to leave fewer signs for trackers.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Look closely when picking fruit or moving around water.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Do not tease, molest, or harass snakes. Snakes cannot close their eyes.
    Therefore, you cannot tell if they are asleep. Some snakes, such as mambas,
    cobras, and bushmasters, will attack aggressively when cornered or guarding
    a nest.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Use sticks to turn logs and rocks.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Wear proper footgear, particularly at night.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Carefully check bedding, shelter, and clothing.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Be calm when you encounter serpents. Snakes cannot hear and you can
    occasionally surprise them when they are sleeping or sunning. Normally, they
    will flee if given the opportunity.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Use extreme care if you must kill snakes for food or safety. Although it
    is not common, warm, sleeping human bodies occasionally attract snakes.</p>
  </li>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 11-1. Venomous Snakes of the World (Continued)</b></p>
<h3><a name="par5">SNAKE-FREE AREAS</a></h3>
<p>11-16. The polar regions are free of snakes due to their inhospitable
environments. Other areas considered to be free of venomous snakes are New
Zealand, Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Ireland, Polynesia, and Hawaii.</p>
<h3><a name="par6">DANGEROUS LIZARDS</a></h3>
<p>11-17. The Gila monster (<i>Heloderma suspectrum</i>) of the American
Southwest and Mexico is a dangerous and poisonous lizard with dark, highly
textured skin marked by pinkish mottling. It is typically 35 to 45 centimeters
(14 to 18 inches) in length and has a thick, stumpy tail. The Gila monster is
unlikely to bite unless molested but has a poisonous bite.</p>
<p>11-18. The Mexican beaded lizard (<i>Heloderma horridum</i>) resembles its
relative, the Gila monster. However, it has more uniform spots rather than bands
of color. It also is poisonous and has a docile nature. You may find it from
Mexico to Central America.</p>
<p>11-19. The komodo dragon is a giant lizard (<i>Varanus komodoensis</i>) that
grows to more than 3 meters (10 feet) in length. It can be dangerous if you try
to capture it. This Indonesian lizard can weigh more than 135 kilograms (300
pounds).</p>
<h3><a name="par7">DANGERS IN RIVERS</a></h3>
<p>11-20. Common sense will tell you to avoid confrontations with hippopotami,
alligators, crocodiles, and other large river creatures. However, there are also
the following smaller river creatures with which you should be cautious.</p>
<p>11-21. Electric eels (<i>Electrophorus electricus</i>) may reach 2 meters (7
feet) in length and 20 centimeters (8 inches) in diameter. Avoid them. They are
capable of generating up to 500 volts of electricity in certain organs of their
body. They use this shock to stun prey and enemies. Normally, you find these
eels in the Orinoco and Amazon River systems in South America. They seem to
prefer shallow waters that are more highly oxygenated and provide more food.
They are bulkier than American eels. Their upper body is dark gray or black with
a lighter-colored underbelly.</p>
<p>11-22. Piranhas (<i>Serrasalmo</i> species) are another hazard of the Orinoco
and Amazon River systems, as well as the Paraguay River Basin, where they are
native. These fish vary greatly in size and coloration, but usually have a
combination of orange undersides and dark tops. They have white, razor-sharp
teeth that are clearly visible. They may be as long as 50 centimeters (20
inches). Use great care when crossing waters where they live. Blood attracts
them. They are most dangerous in shallow waters during the dry season.</p>
<p>11-23. Be careful when handling and capturing large freshwater turtles, such
as the snapping turtles and soft-shelled turtles of North America and the
matamata and other turtles of South America. All of these turtles will bite in
self-defense and can amputate fingers and toes.</p>
<p>11-24. The platypus or duckbill (<i>Ornithorhyncus anatinus</i>) is the only
member of its family and is easily recognized. It has a long body covered with
grayish, short hair, a tail like a beaver, and a bill like a duck. Growing up to
60 centimeters (24 inches) in length, it may appear to be a good food source,
but this egg-laying mammal, the only one in the world, is very dangerous. The
male has a poisonous spur on each hind foot that can inflict intensely painful
wounds. You find the platypus only in Australia, mainly along mud banks on
waterways.</p>
<h3><a name="par8">DANGERS IN BAYS AND ESTUARIES</a></h3>
<p>11-25. In areas where seas and rivers come together, there are dangers
associated with both freshwater and saltwater. In shallow saltwaters, there are
many creatures that can inflict pain and cause infection to develop. Stepping on
sea urchins, for example, can produce pain and infection. When moving about in
shallow water, wear some form of footgear and shuffle your feet along the
bottom, rather than picking up your feet and stepping.</p>
<p>11-26. Stingrays (<i>Dasyatidae</i> species) are a real hazard in shallow
waters, especially tropical waters. The type of bottom appears to be irrelevant.
There is a great variance between species, but all have a sharp spike in their
tail that may be venomous and can cause extremely painful wounds if stepped on.
All rays have a typical shape that resembles a kite. You find them along the
coasts of the Americas, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<h3><a name="par9">SALTWATER DANGERS</a></h3>
<p>11-27. There are several fish that you should not handle, touch, or contact.
There are also others that you should not eat. These fish are described below.</p>
<p>11-28. Sharks are the most feared animal in the sea. Usually, shark attacks
cannot be avoided and are considered accidents. You should take every precaution
to avoid any contact with sharks. There are many shark species, but in general,
dangerous sharks have wide mouths and visible teeth, while relatively harmless
ones have small mouths on the underside of their heads. However, any shark can
inflict painful and often fatal injuries, either through bites or through
abrasions from their rough skin.</p>
<p>11-29. Rabbitfish or spinefoot (<i>Siganidae</i> species) live mainly on
coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific oceans. They have very sharp, possibly
venomous spines in their fins. Handle them with care, if at all. This fish, like
many others of the dangerous fish in this section, is considered edible by
native peoples where the fish are found, but deaths occur from careless
handling. Seek other nonpoisonous fish to eat if possible.</p>
<p>11-30. Tang or surgeonfish (<i>Acanthuridae</i> species) average 20 to 25
centimeters (8 to 10 inches) in length and often are beautifully colored. They
are called surgeonfish because of the scalpel-like spines located in the tail.
The wounds inflicted by these spines can bring about death through infection,
envenomation, and loss of blood, which may incidentally attract sharks.</p>
<p>11-31. Toadfish (<i>Batrachoididae</i> species) live in tropical waters off
the Gulf Coast of the United States and along both coasts of Central and South
America. These dully-colored fish average 18 to 25 centimeters (7 to 10 inches)
in length. They typically bury themselves in the sand to await fish and other
prey. They have sharp, very toxic spines along their backs.</p>
<p>11-32. Poisonous scorpion fish or zebra fish (<i>Scorpaenidae</i> species)
are mostly around reefs in the tropical Indian and Pacific oceans and
occasionally in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas. They average 30 to 75
centimeters (12 to 29 inches) in length. Their coloration is highly variable,
from reddish brown to almost purple or brownish yellow. They have long, wavy
fins and spines and their sting is intensely painful. Less poisonous relatives
live in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>11-33. Stonefish (<i>Synanceja</i> species) are in the Pacific and Indian
oceans. They can inject a painful venom from their dorsal spines when stepped on
or handled carelessly. They are almost impossible to see because of their lumpy
shape and drab colors. They range in size up to 40 centimeters (16 inches).</p>
<p>11-34. Weever fish (<i>Trachinidae</i> species) average 30 centimeters (12
inches) long. They are hard to see as they lie buried in the sand off the coasts
of Europe, Africa, and the Mediterranean. Their color is usually a dull brown.
They have venomous spines on the back and gills.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> <a href="survival://f.htm">Appendix
F</a> provides more details on these venomous fish and toxic mollusks.</p>
<p>11-35. The livers of polar bears are considered toxic due to high
concentrations of vitamin A. There is a chance of death after eating this organ.
Another toxic meat is the flesh of the hawksbill turtle. These animals are
distinguished by a down-turned bill and yellow polka dots on their neck and
front flippers. They weigh more than 275 kilograms (605 pounds) and are unlikely
to be captured.</p>
<p>11-36. Many fish living in lagoons, estuaries, or reefs near shore are
poisonous to eat, though some are only seasonally dangerous. Although the
majority are tropical fish; be wary of eating any unidentifiable fish wherever
you are. Some predatory fish, such as barracuda and snapper, may become toxic if
the fish they feed on in shallow waters are poisonous. The most poisonous types
appear to have parrotlike beaks and hard shell-like skins with spines and can
often inflate their bodies like balloons. However, at certain times of the year,
indigenous populations consider the puffer a delicacy.</p>
<p>11-37. The blowfish or puffer (<i>Tetraodontidae</i> species) are more
tolerant of cold water. They live along tropical and temperate coasts worldwide,
even in some of the rivers of Southeast Asia and Africa. Stout-bodied and round,
many of these fish have short spines and can inflate themselves into a ball when
alarmed or agitated. Their blood, liver, and gonads are so toxic that as little
as 28 milligrams (1 ounce) can be fatal. These fish vary in color and size,
growing up to 75 centimeters (29 inches) in length.</p>
<p>11-38. The triggerfish (<i>Balistidae</i> species) occur in great variety,
mostly in tropical seas. They are deep-bodied and compressed, resembling a
seagoing pancake up to 60 centimeters (24 inches) in length, with large and
sharp dorsal spines. Avoid them all, as many have poisonous flesh.</p>
<p>11-39. Although most people avoid them because of their ferocity, they
occasionally eat barracuda (<i>Sphyraena barracuda</i>). These predators of
mostly tropical seas can reach almost 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length and have
attacked humans without provocation. They occasionally carry the poison
ciguatera in their flesh, making them deadly if consumed.</p>
<h3><a name="par10">OTHER DANGEROUS SEA CREATURES</a></h3>
<p>11-40. The blue-ringed octopus, jellyfish, and the cone and auger shells are
other dangerous sea creatures. Therefore, you should always be alert and move
carefully in any body of water.</p>
<p>11-41. Most octopi are excellent when properly prepared. However, the
blue-ringed octopus (<i>Hapalochlaena lunulata</i>) can inflict a deadly bite
from its parrotlike beak. Fortunately, it is restricted to the Great Barrier
Reef of Australia and is very small. It is easily recognized by its grayish
white overall color and irridescent blue rings. Authorities warn that all
tropical octopus species should be treated with caution because of their
poisonous bites, although their flesh is edible.</p>
<p>11-42. Deaths related to jellyfish are rare, but the sting they inflict is
extremely painful. The Portuguese man-of-war resembles a large pink or purple
balloon floating on the sea. It has poisonous tentacles hanging up to 12 meters
(40 feet) below its body. The huge tentacles are actually colonies of stinging
cells. Most known deaths from jellyfish are attributed to the man-of-war. Other
jellyfish can inflict very painful stings as well. Avoid the long tentacles of
any jellyfish, even those washed up on the beach and apparently dead.</p>
<p>11-43. The subtropical and tropical cone shells (<i>Conidae</i> species) have
a venomous harpoonlike barb. All have a fine netlike pattern on the shell. A

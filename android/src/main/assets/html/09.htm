  <blockquote>
    <p>After having solved the problems of finding water, shelter, and animal
    food, you will have to consider the use of plants you can eat. In a survival
    situation you should always be on the lookout for familiar wild foods and
    live off the land whenever possible.</p>
    <p>You must not count on being able to go for days without food as some
    sources would suggest. Even in the most static survival situation,
    maintaining health through a complete and nutritious diet is essential to
    maintaining strength and peace of mind.</p>
    <p>Nature can provide you with food that will let you survive almost any
    ordeal, if you don't eat the wrong plant. You must therefore learn as much
    as possible beforehand about the flora of the region where you will be
    operating. Plants can provide you with medicines in a survival situation.
    Plants can supply you with weapons and raw materials to construct shelters
    and build fires. Plants can even provide you with chemicals for poisoning
    fish, preserving animal hides, and for camouflaging yourself and your
    equipment.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> You will find illustrations of the plants described in this
    chapter in <a href="survival://b.htm">Appendixes
    B</a> and <a href="survival://c.htm">C</a>.</p>

<p>9-1. Plants are valuable sources of food because they are widely available,
easily procured, and, in the proper combinations, can meet all your nutritional
needs.</p>

<p>9-2. Absolutely identify plants before using them as food. Poison hemlock has
killed people who mistook it for its relatives, wild carrots and wild parsnips.</p>
<p>9-3. You may find yourself in a situation where you have had the chance to
learn the plant life of the region in which you must survive. In this case you
can use the Universal Edibility Test to determine which plants you can eat and
which to avoid.</p>
<p>9-4. It is important to be able to recognize both cultivated and wild edible
plants in a survival situation. Most of the information in this chapter is
directed toward identifying wild plants because information relating to
cultivated plants is more readily available.</p>
<p>9-5. Consider the following when collecting wild plants for food:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Plants growing near homes and occupied buildings or along roadsides may
    have been sprayed with pesticides. Wash these plants thoroughly. In more
    highly developed countries with many automobiles, avoid roadside plants, if
    possible, due to contamination from exhaust emissions.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Plants growing in contaminated water or in water containing <i>Giardia
    lamblia </i>and other parasites are contaminated themselves. Boil or
    disinfect them.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Some plants develop extremely dangerous fungal toxins. To lessen the
    chance of accidental poisoning, do not eat any fruit that is starting to
    spoil or is showing signs of mildew or fungus.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Plants of the same species may differ in their toxic or subtoxic
    compounds content because of genetic or environmental factors. One example
    of this is the foliage of the common chokecherry. Some chokecherry plants
    have high concentrations of deadly cyanide compounds but others have low
    concentrations or none. Horses have died from eating wilted wild cherry
    leaves. Avoid any weed, leaves, or seeds with an almondlike scent, a
    characteristic of the cyanide compounds.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Some people are more susceptible to gastric distress (from plants) than
    others. If you are sensitive in this way, avoid unknown wild plants. If you
    are extremely sensitive to poison ivy, avoid products from this family,
    including any parts from sumacs, mangoes, and cashews.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Some edible wild plants, such as acorns and water lily rhizomes, are
    bitter. These bitter substances, usually tannin compounds, make them
    unpalatable. Boiling them in several changes of water will usually remove
    these bitter properties.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Many valuable wild plants have high concentrations of oxalate compounds,
    also known as oxalic acid. Oxalates produce a sharp burning sensation in
    your mouth and throat and damage the kidneys. Baking, roasting, or drying
    usually destroys these oxalate crystals. The corm (bulb) of the
    jack-in-the-pulpit is known as the &quot;Indian turnip,&quot; but you can
    eat it only after removing these crystals by slow baking or by drying.</p>
  </li>

        <p>Do not eat mushrooms in a survival situation! The only way to tell if
        a mushroom is edible is by positive identification. There is no room for
        experimentation. Symptoms caused by the most dangerous mushrooms
        affecting the central nervous system may not show up until several days
        after ingestion. By that time, it is too late to reverse their effects.</p>

<p><b>PLANT IDENTIFICATION</b></p>
<p>9-6. You identify plants, other than by memorizing particular varieties
through familiarity, by using such factors as leaf shape and margin, leaf
arrangements, and root structure.</p>
<p>9-7. The basic leaf margins (<a href="#fig9-1">Figure 9-1</a>) are toothed,
lobed, and toothless or smooth.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig9-1"></a><img alt="Figure 9-1. Leaf Margins" src="fig09-01.png" width="350" height="169"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 9-1. Leaf Margins</b></p>
<p>9-8. These leaves may be lance-shaped, elliptical, egg-shaped, oblong,
wedge-shaped, triangular, long-pointed, or top-shaped (<a href="#fig9-2">Figure
9-2</a>).</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig9-2"></a><img alt="Figure 9-2. Leaf Shapes" src="fig09-02.png" width="350" height="280"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 9-2. Leaf Shapes</b></p>
<p>9-9. The basic types of leaf arrangements (<a href="#fig9-3">Figure 9-3</a>)
are opposite, alternate, compound, simple, and basal rosette.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig9-3"></a><img alt="Figure 9-3. Leaf Arrangements" src="fig09-03.png" width="350" height="221"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 9-3. Leaf Arrangements</b></p>
<p>9-10. The basic types of root structures are the taproot, tuber, bulb,
rhizome, clove, corm, and crown (<a href="#fig9-4">Figure 9-4</a>). Bulbs are
familiar to us as onions and, when sliced in half, will show concentric rings.
Cloves are those bulblike structures that remind us of garlic and will separate
into small pieces when broken apart. This characteristic separates wild onions
from wild garlic. Taproots resemble carrots and may be single-rooted or
branched, but usually only one plant stalk arises from each root. Tubers are
like potatoes and daylilies. You will find these structures either on strings or
in clusters underneath the parent plants. Rhizomes are large creeping rootstock
or underground stems. Many plants arise from the &quot;eyes&quot; of these
roots. Corms are similar to bulbs but are solid when cut rather than possessing
rings. A crown is the type of root structure found on plants such as asparagus.
Crowns look much like a mophead under the soil's surface.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig9-4"></a><img alt="Figure 9-4. Root Structures" src="fig09-04.png" width="350" height="280"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 9-4. Root Structures</b></p>
<p>9-11. Learn as much as possible about the unique characteristics of plants
you intend to use for food. Some plants have both edible and poisonous parts.
Many are edible only at certain times of the year. Others may have poisonous
relatives that look very similar to the varieties you can eat or use for
medicine.</p>
<p><b>UNIVERSAL EDIBILITY TEST</b></p>
<p>9-12. There are many plants throughout the world. Tasting or swallowing even
a small portion of some can cause severe discomfort, extreme internal disorders,
and even death. Therefore, if you have the slightest doubt about a plant's
edibility, apply the Universal Edibility Test (<a href="#fig9-5">Figure 9-5</a>)
before eating any portion of it.</p>

<p><b>Figure 9-5. Universal Edibility Test</b></p>
</center>
<p>9-13. Before testing a plant for edibility, make sure there are enough plants
to make the testing worth your time and effort. Each part of a plant (roots,
leaves, flowers, and so on) requires more than 24 hours to test. Do not waste
time testing a plant that is not relatively abundant in the area.</p>
<p>9-14. Remember, eating large portions of plant food on an empty stomach may
cause diarrhea, nausea, or cramps. Two good examples of this are such familiar
foods as green apples and wild onions. Even after testing plant food and finding
it safe, eat it in moderation.</p>
<p>9-15. You can see from the steps and time involved in testing for edibility
just how important it is to be able to identify edible plants.</p>
<p>9-16. To avoid potentially poisonous plants, stay away from any wild or
unknown plants that have—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Milky or discolored sap.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Beans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods.</p>
  <li>
    <p>A bitter or soapy taste.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Spines, fine hairs, or thorns.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Foliage that resembles dill, carrot, parsnip, or parsley.</p>
  <li>
    <p>An almond scent in woody parts and leaves.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Grain heads with pink, purplish, or black spurs.</p>
  <li>
    <p>A three-leafed growth pattern.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>9-17. Using the above criteria as eliminators when choosing plants for the
Universal Edibility Test will cause you to avoid some edible plants. More
important, these criteria will often help you avoid plants that are potentially
toxic to eat or touch.</p>
<p>9-18. An entire encyclopedia of edible wild plants could be written, but
space limits the number of plants presented here. Learn as much as possible
about the plant life of the areas where you train regularly and where you expect
to be traveling or working. <a href="#fig9-6">Figure 9-6</a> list some of the
most common edible and medicinal plants. Detailed descriptions and photographs
of these and other common plants are in <a href="survival://b.htm">Appendix

<p align="center"><b>Figure 9-7. Types of Edible Seaweed</b></p>
<p>9-20. When gathering seaweed for food, find living plants attached to rocks
or floating free. Seaweed washed onshore any length of time may be spoiled or
decayed. You can dry freshly harvested seaweed for later use.</p>
<p>9-21. Different types of seaweed should be prepared in different ways. You
can dry thin and tender varieties in the sun or over a fire until crisp. Crush
and add these to soups or broths. Boil thick, leathery seaweeds for a short time
to soften them. Eat them as a vegetable or with other foods. You can eat some
varieties raw after testing for edibility.</p>
<p><b>PREPARATION OF PLANT FOOD</b></p>
<p>9-22. Although some plants or plant parts are edible raw, you must cook
others for them to be edible or palatable. Edible means that a plant or food
will provide you with necessary nutrients; palatable means that it is pleasing
to eat. Many wild plants are edible but barely palatable. It is a good idea to
learn to identify, prepare, and eat wild foods.</p>
<p>9-23. Methods used to improve the taste of plant food include soaking,
boiling, cooking, or leaching. Leaching is done by crushing the food (for
example, acorns), placing it in a strainer, and pouring boiling water through it
or immersing it in running water.</p>
<p>9-24. Boil leaves, stems, and buds until tender, changing the water, if
necessary, to remove any bitterness.</p>
<p>9-25. Boil, bake, or roast tubers and roots. Drying helps to remove caustic
oxalates from some roots like those in the <i>Arum</i> family.</p>
<p>9-26. Leach acorns in water, if necessary, to remove the bitterness. Some
nuts, such as chestnuts, are good raw, but taste better roasted.</p>
<p>9-27. You can eat many grains and seeds raw until they mature. When they are
hard or dry, you may have to boil or grind them into meal or flour.</p>
<p>9-28. The sap from many trees, such as maples, birches, walnuts, and
sycamores, contains sugar. You may boil these saps down to a syrup for
sweetening. It takes about 35 liters of maple sap to make 1 liter of maple
syrup!</p>
<h3><a name="par2">PLANTS FOR MEDICINE</a></h3>
<p>9-29. In using plants for medical treatment, positive identification of the
plants involved is as critical as when using them for food. Proper use of these
plants is equally important.</p>
<p><b>TERMS AND DEFINITIONS</b></p>
<p>9-30. The following terms and their definitions are associated with medicinal
plant use:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p><i>Poultice.</i> This is crushed leaves or other plant parts, possibly
    heated, that are applied to a wound or sore either directly or wrapped in
    cloth or paper. Poultices, when hot, increase the circulation in the
    affected area and help healing through the chemicals present in the plants.
    As the poultice dries out, it draws the toxins out of a wound. A poultice
    should be prepared to a &quot;mashed potatoes-like&quot; consistency and
    applied as warm as the patient can stand.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Infusion or tisane or tea.</i> This blend is the preparation of
    medicinal herbs for internal or external application. You place a small
    quantity of a herb in a container, pour hot water over it, and let it steep
    (covered or uncovered) before use. Care must always be taken to not drink
    too much of a tea in the beginning of treatment as it may have adverse
    reactions on an empty stomach.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Decoction.</i> This is the extract of a boiled-down or simmered herb
    leaf or root. You add herb leaf or root to water. You bring them to a
    sustained boil or simmer them to draw their chemicals into the water. The
    average ratio is about 28 to 56 grams (1 to 2 ounces) of herb to 0.5 liter
    of water.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Expressed juice.</i> These are liquids or saps squeezed from plant
    material and either applied to the wound or made into another medicine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>9-31. Many natural remedies work slower than the medicines you know.
Therefore, start with smaller doses and allow more time for them to take effect.
Naturally, some will act more rapidly than others. Many of these treatments are
addressed in more detail in <a href="survival://04.htm">Chapter
4</a>.</p>
<p><b>SPECIFIC REMEDIES</b></p>
<p>9-32. The following remedies are for use only in a survival situation. Do not
use them routinely as some can be potentially toxic and have serious long- term
effects (for example, cancer).</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p><i>Antidiarrheals for diarrhea.</i> This can be one of the most
    debilitating illnesses for a survivor or prisoner of war. Drink tea made
    from the roots of blackberries and their relatives to stop diarrhea. White
    oak bark and other barks containing tannin are also effective when made into
    a strong tea. However, because of possible negative effects on the kidneys,
    use them with caution and only when nothing else is available. Clay, ashes,
    charcoal, powdered chalk, powdered bones, and pectin can be consumed or
    mixed in a tannic acid tea with good results. These powdered mixtures should
    be taken in a dose of two tablespoons every 2 hours. Clay and pectin can be
    mixed together to give a crude form of Kaopectate. Pectin is obtainable from
    the inner part of citrus fruit rinds or from apple pomace. Tea made from
    cowberry, cranberry, or hazel leaves works, too. Because of its inherent
    danger to an already under-nourished survivor, several of these methods may
    need to be tried simultaneously to stop debilitating diarrhea, which can
    quickly dehydrate even a healthy individual.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Antihemorrhagics for bleeding.</i> Make medications to stop bleeding
    from plantain leaves, or, most effectively, from the leaves of the common
    yarrow or woundwort <i>(Achillea millefolium).</i> These mostly give a
    physical barrier to the bleeding. Prickly pear (the raw, peeled part) or
    witch hazel can be applied to wounds. Both are good for their astringent
    properties (they shrink blood vessels). For bleeding gums or mouth sores,
    sweet gum can be chewed or used as a toothpick. This provides some chemical
    and antiseptic properties as well.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Antiseptics to clean infections.</i> Use antiseptics to cleanse
    wounds, snake bites, sores, or rashes. You can make antiseptics from the
    expressed juice of wild onion or garlic, the expressed juice from chickweed
    leaves, or the crushed leaves of dock. You can also make antiseptics from a
    decoction of burdock root, mallow leaves or roots, or white oak bark (tannic
    acid). Prickly pear, slippery elm, yarrow, and sweet gum are all good
    antiseptics as well. All these medications are for external use only. Two of
    the best antiseptics are sugar and honey. Sugar should be applied to the
    wound until it becomes syrupy, then washed off and reapplied. Honey should
    be applied three times daily (see <a href="survival://04.htm">Chapter
    4</a>). Honey is by far the best of the antiseptics for open wounds and
    burns, with sugar being second.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Antipyretics for fevers.</i> Treat a fever with a tea made from willow
    bark, an infusion of elder flowers or fruit, linden flower tea, and aspen or
    slippery elm bark decoction. Yarrow tea is also good. Peppermint tea is
    reportedly good for fevers.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Colds and sore throats.</i> Treat these illnesses with a decoction
    made from either plantain leaves or willow bark. You can also use a tea made
    from burdock roots, mallow or mullein flowers or roots, and yarrow or mint
    leaves.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Analgesics for aches, pains, and sprains.</i> Treat these conditions
    with externally applied poultices of dock, plantain, chickweed, willow bark,
    garlic, or sorrel. Sweet gum has some analgesic (pain relief) properties.
    Chewing the willow bark or making a tea from it is the best for pain relief
    as it contains the raw component of aspirin. You can also use salves made by
    mixing the expressed juices of these plants in animal fat or vegetable oils.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Antihistamines and astringents for itching or contact dermatitis.</i>
    Relieve the itch from insect bites, sunburn, or plant poisoning rashes by
    applying a poultice of jewelweed <i>(Impatiens biflora)</i> or witch hazel,
    which give a cooling relief and dry out the weeping <i>(Hamamelis virginiana)
    </i>leaves. The jewelweed juice will help when applied to poison ivy,
    rashes, or insect stings. Jewelweed and aloe vera help relieve sunburn. In
    addition, dandelion sap, crushed cloves of garlic, and sweet gum have been
    used. Crushed leaves of burdock have received only so-so reports of success,
    but crushed, green plantain leaves show relief over a few days. Jewelweed is
    probably the best of these plants. Tobacco will deaden the nerve endings and
    can also be used to treat toothaches.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Sedatives.</i> Get help in falling asleep by brewing a tea made from
    mint leaves or passionflower leaves.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Hemorrhoids.</i> Treat them with external washes from elm bark or oak
    bark tea, from the expressed juice of plantain leaves, or from a Solomon's
    seal root decoction. Tannic acid or witch hazel will provide soothing relief
    because of their astringent properties.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Heat rash. </i>Tannic acid or witch hazel will provide soothing relief
    because of their astringent properties but cornstarch or any crushed and
    powdered, nonpoisonous plant should help to dry out the rash after a
    thorough cleansing.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Constipation.</i> Relieve constipation by drinking decoctions from
    dandelion leaves, rose hips, or walnut bark. Eating raw daylily flowers will
    also help. Large amounts of water in any form are critical to relieving
    constipation.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Antihelminthics for worms or intestinal parasites.</i> Most treatment
    for worms or parasites are toxic—just more so for the worms or parasites
    than for humans. Therefore, all treatments should be used in moderation.
    Treatments include tea made from tansy <i>(Tanacetum vulgare)</i> or from
    wild carrot (poisonous) leaves. Very strong tannic acid can also be used
    with caution as it is very hard on the liver. See <a href="survival://04.htm">Chapter
    4</a> for more deworming techniques.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Antiflatulents for gas and cramps.</i> Use a tea made from carrot
    seeds; use tea made from mint leaves to settle the stomach.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Antifungal washes.</i> Make a decoction of walnut leaves, oak bark, or
    acorns to treat ringworm and athlete's foot. Apply it frequently to the
    site, alternating with exposure to direct sunlight. Broad-leaf plantain has
    also been used with success but any treatment should be used in addition to
    sunlight if possible. Jewelweed and vinegar make excellent washes but are
    sometimes difficult to find.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Burns.</i> Tannic acid, sugar, and honey can be used as explained in <a href="survival://04.htm">Chapter
    4</a>.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Dentifrices for teeth. </i>See <a href="survival://04.htm">Chapter
    4</a> for other techniques in addition to using twigs of sweet gum for its
    anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antiseptic properties.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Insect repellents. </i>Garlic and onions can be eaten and the raw
    plant juice rubbed on the skin to repel some insects. Sassafras leaves can
    be rubbed on the skin. Cedar chips may help repel insects around your
    shelter.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Tannic acid. </i>Because tannic acid is used for so many treatments
    (burns, antihemorrhagics, antihelminthics, antiseptics, antidiarrheals,
    antifungals, bronchitis, skin inflammation, lice), a note as to its
    preparation is in order. All thready plants, especially trees, contain
    tannic acid. Hardwood trees generally contain more than softwood trees. Of
    the hardwoods, oak—especially red and chestnut—contain the highest
    amount. The warty looking knots in oak trees can contain as much as 28
    percent tannic acid. This knot, the inner bark of trees, and pine needles
    (cut into 2-centimeter [1-inch] strips), can all be boiled down to extract
    tannic acid. Boiling can be done in as little as 15 minutes (very weak), to
    2 hours (moderate), through 12 hours to 3 days (very strong). The stronger
    concoctions will have a dark color that will vary depending on the type of
    tree. All will have an increasingly vile taste in relation to their
    concentration.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="par3">MISCELLANEOUS USES OF PLANTS</a></h3>
<p>9-33. Plants can be your ally as long as you use them cautiously. Be sure
that you know the plant and how to use it. Some additional uses of plants are as
follows:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Make dyes from various plants to color clothing or to camouflage your
    skin. Usually, you will have to boil the plants to get the best results.
    Onionskins produce yellow, walnut hulls produce brown, and pokeberries
    provide purple dye.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Make fibers and cordage from plant fibers. Most commonly used are the
    stems from nettles and milkweeds, yucca plants, and the inner bark of trees
    like the linden.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Make tinder for starting fires from cattail fluff, cedar bark, lighter
    knot wood from pine trees, or hardened sap from resinous wood trees.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Make insulation by fluffing up female cattail heads or milkweed down.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Make insect repellents by placing sassafras leaves in your shelter or by
    burning or smudging cattail seed hair fibers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>9-34. Whether you use plants for food, medicine, or the construction of
shelters or equipment, the <b>key</b> to their safe use is <b>positive
identification</b>.</p>

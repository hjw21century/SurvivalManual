    <p>Plants basically poison on contact, through ingestion, by absorption, or
    by inhalation. They cause painful skin irritations upon contact, they cause
    internal poisoning when eaten, and they poison through skin absorption or
    inhalation in to the respiratory system. Many edible plants have deadly
    relatives and look-alikes. Preparation for military missions includes
    learning to identify those harmful plants in the target area. Positive
    identification of edible plants will eliminate the danger of accidental
    poisoning. There is no room for experimentation where plants are concerned,
    especially in unfamiliar territory.</p>

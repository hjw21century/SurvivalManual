    <p>In many survival situations, the ability to start a fire can make the
    difference between living and dying. Fire can fulfill many needs. It can
    provide warmth and comfort. It not only cooks and preserves food, it also
    provides warmth in the form of heated food that saves calories our body
    normally uses to produce body heat. You can use fire to purify water,
    sterilize bandages, signal for rescue, and provide protection from animals.
    It can be a psychological boost by providing peace of mind and
    companionship. You can also use fire to produce tools and weapons.</p>
    <p>Fire can cause problems, as well. The enemy can detect the smoke and
    light it produces. It can cause forest fires or destroy essential equipment.
    Fire can also cause burns and carbon monoxide poisoning when used in
    shelters.</p>
    <p>Weigh your need for fire against your need to avoid enemy detection.</p>

<h3><a name="par1">BASIC FIRE PRINCIPLES</a></h3>
<p>7-1. To build a fire, it helps to understand the basic principles of a fire.
Fuel (in a nongaseous state) does not burn directly. When you apply heat to a
fuel, it produces a gas. This gas, combined with oxygen in the air, burns.</p>
<p>7-2. Understanding the concept of the fire triangle is very important in
correctly constructing and maintaining a fire. The three sides of the triangle
represent <b>air, heat,</b> and <b>fuel</b><i>.</i> If you remove any of these,
the fire will go out. The correct ratio of these components is very important
for a fire to burn at its greatest capability. The only way to learn this ratio
is to practice.</p>
<h3><a name="par2">SITE SELECTION AND PREPARATION</a></h3>
<p>7-3. You will have to decide what site and arrangement to use. Before
building a fire consider—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>The area (terrain and climate) in which you are operating.</p>
  <li>
    <p>The materials and tools available.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Time; how much time do you have?</p>
  <li>
    <p>Need; why do you need a fire?</p>
  <li>
    <p>Security; how close is the enemy?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>7-4. Look for a dry spot that—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Is protected from the wind.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Is suitably placed in relation to your shelter (if any).</p>
  <li>
    <p>Will concentrate the heat in the direction you desire.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Has a supply of wood or other fuel available. (<a href="#fig7-4">Figure
    7-4</a> lists types of material you can use.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>7-5. If you are in a wooded or brush-covered area, clear the brush and scrape
the surface soil from the spot you have selected. Clear a circle at least 1
meter (3 feet) in diameter so there is little chance of the fire spreading.</p>
<p>7-6. If time allows, construct a fire wall using logs or rocks. This wall
will help to reflect or direct the heat where you want it (<a href="#fig7-1">Figure
7-1</a>). It will also reduce flying sparks and cut down on the amount of wind
blowing into the fire. However, you will need enough wind to keep the fire
burning.</p>

<p>7-7. In some situations, you may find that an underground fireplace will best
meet your needs. It conceals the fire and serves well for cooking food. To make
an underground fireplace or Dakota fire hole (<a href="#fig7-2">Figure 7-2</a>)—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Dig a hole in the ground.</p>
  <li>
    <p>On the upwind side of this hole, poke or dig a large connecting hole for
    ventilation.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Build your fire in the hole as illustrated.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 7-2. Dakota Fire Hole</b></p>
<p>7-8. If you are in a snow-covered area, use green logs to make a dry base for
your fire (<a href="#fig7-3">Figure 7-3</a>). Trees with wrist-sized trunks are
easily broken in extreme cold. Cut or break several green logs and lay them side
by side on top of the snow. Add one or two more layers. Lay the top layer of
logs opposite those below it.</p>

<h3><a name="par3">FIRE MATERIAL SELECTION</a></h3>
<p>7-9. You need three types of materials (<a href="#fig7-4">Figure 7-4</a>) to
build a fire.</p>

<p>7-10. Tinder is dry material that ignites with little heat—a spark starts a
fire. The tinder must be absolutely dry to be sure just a spark will ignite it.
If you have a device that generates only sparks, charred cloth will be almost
essential. It holds a spark for long periods, allowing you to put tinder on the
hot area to generate a small flame. You can make charred cloth by heating cotton
cloth until it turns black, but does not burn. Once it is black, you must keep
it in an airtight container to keep it dry. Prepare this cloth well in advance
of any survival situation. Add it to your individual survival kit. Other
impromptu items could be alcohol pads or petroleum jelly gauze.</p>
<p>7-11. Kindling is readily combustible material that you add to the burning
tinder. Again, this material should be absolutely dry to ensure rapid burning.
Kindling increases the fire's temperature so that it will ignite less
combustible material.</p>
<p>7-12. Fuel is less combustible material that burns slowly and steadily once
ignited.</p>
<h3><a name="par4">HOW TO BUILD A FIRE</a></h3>
<p>7-13. There are several methods for laying a fire and each one has
advantages. The situation you are in will determine which of the following fires
to use.</p>
<p><b>TEPEE</b></p>
<p>7-14. To make a tepee fire (<a href="#fig7-5">Figure 7-5</a>), arrange the
tinder and a few sticks of kindling in the shape of a tepee or cone. Light the
center. As the tepee burns, the outside logs will fall inward, feeding the fire.
This type of fire burns well even with wet wood.</p>
<p><b>LEAN-TO</b></p>
<p>7-15. To lay a lean-to fire (<a href="#fig7-5">Figure 7-5</a>), push a green
stick into the ground at a 30-degree angle. Point the end of the stick in the
direction of the wind. Place some tinder deep under this lean-to stick. Lean
pieces of kindling against the lean-to stick. Light the tinder. As the kindling
catches fire from the tinder, add more kindling.</p>
<p><b>CROSS-DITCH</b></p>
<p>7-16. To use the cross-ditch method (<a href="#fig7-5">Figure 7-5</a>),
scratch a cross about 30 centimeters (12 inches) in size in the ground. Dig the
cross 7.5 centimeters (about 3 inches) deep. Put a large wad of tinder in the
middle of the cross. Build a kindling pyramid above the tinder. The shallow
ditch allows air to sweep under the tinder to provide a draft.</p>
<p><b>PYRAMID</b></p>
<p>7-17. To lay the pyramid fire (<a href="#fig7-5">Figure 7-5</a>), place two
small logs or branches parallel on the ground. Place a solid layer of small logs
across the parallel logs. Add three or four more layers of logs, each layer
smaller than and at a right angle to the layer below it. Make a starter fire on
top of the pyramid. As the starter fire burns, it will ignite the logs below it.
This gives you a fire that burns downward, requiring no attention during the
night.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig7-5"></a><img alt="Figure 7-5. Methods for Laying Fires" src="fig07-05.png" width="350" height="206"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 7-5. Methods for Laying Fires</b></p>
<p>7-18. There are several other ways to lay a fire that are quite effective.
Your situation and the material available in the area may make another method
more suitable.</p>
<h3><a name="par5">HOW TO LIGHT A FIRE</a></h3>
<p>7-19. Always light your fire from the upwind side. Make sure you lay the
tinder, kindling, and fuel so that your fire will burn as long as you need it.
Igniters provide the initial heat required to start the tinder burning. They
fall into two categories: modern methods and primitive methods.</p>
<p><b>MODERN METHODS</b></p>
<p>7-20. Modern igniters use modern devices. These are items that we normally
think of to start a fire.</p>
<p><b>Matches</b></p>
<p>7-21. Make sure these matches are waterproof. Also, store them in a
waterproof container along with a dependable striker pad.</p>
<p><b>Convex Lens</b></p>
<p>7-22. Use this method (<a href="#fig7-6">Figure 7-6</a>) only on bright,
sunny days. The lens can come from binoculars, a camera, telescopic sights, or
magnifying glasses. Angle the lens to concentrate the sun's rays on the tinder.
Hold the lens over the same spot until the tinder begins to smolder. Gently blow
or fan the tinder into a flame and apply it to the fire lay.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig7-6"></a><img alt="Figure 7-6. Lens Method" src="fig07-06.png" width="350" height="147"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 7-6. Lens Method</b></p>
<p><b>Metal Match</b></p>
<p>7-23. Place a flat, dry leaf under your tinder with a portion exposed. Place
the tip of the metal match on the dry leaf, holding the metal match in one hand
and a knife in the other. Scrape your knife against the metal match to produce
sparks. The sparks will hit the tinder. When the tinder starts to smolder,
proceed as above.</p>
<p><b>Battery</b></p>
<p>7-24. Use a battery to generate a spark. Use of this method depends on the
type of battery available. Attach a wire to each terminal. Touch the ends of the
bare wires together next to the tinder so the sparks will ignite it.</p>
<p><b>Gunpowder</b></p>
<p>7-25. Often, you will have ammunition with your equipment. If so, carefully
extract the bullet from the shell casing by moving the bullet back and forth.
Use the gunpowder as tinder. Discard the casing and primers. A spark will ignite
the powder.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Be extremely careful during this operation as the primers are
still sensitive and even a small pile of gunpowder can give surprising results.</p>
<p><b>PRIMITIVE METHODS</b></p>
<p>7-26. Primitive igniters are those attributed to our early ancestors. They
can be time-consuming, which requires you to be patient and persistent.</p>
<p><b>Flint and Steel</b></p>
<p>7-27. The direct spark method is the easiest of the primitive methods to use.
The flint and steel method is the most reliable of the direct spark methods.
Strike a flint or other hard, sharp-edged rock with a piece of carbon steel
(stainless steel will not produce a good spark). This method requires a
loose-jointed wrist and practice. When the tinder catches a spark, blow on it.
The spark will spread and burst into flames.</p>
<p><b>Fire-Plow</b></p>
<p>7-28. The fire-plow (<a href="#fig7-7">Figure 7-7</a>) is a friction method
of ignition. To use this method, cut a straight groove in a softwood base and
plow the blunt tip of a hardwood shaft up and down the groove. The plowing
action of the shaft pushes out small particles of wood fibers. Then, as you
apply more pressure on each stroke, the friction ignites the wood particles.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig7-7"></a><img alt="Figure 7-7. Fire-Plow" src="fig07-07.png" width="350" height="241"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 7-7. Fire-Plow</b></p>
<p><b>Bow and Drill</b></p>
<p>7-29. The technique of starting a fire with a bow and drill (<a href="#fig7-8">Figure
7-8</a>) is simple, but you must exert much effort and be persistent to produce
a fire. You need the following items to use this method:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p><i>Socket.</i> The socket is an easily grasped stone or piece of hardwood
    with a slight depression in one side. Use it to hold the drill in place and
    to apply downward pressure.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Drill.</i> The drill should be a straight, seasoned hardwood stick
    about 2 centimeters (3/4 inch) in diameter and 25 centimeters (10 inches)
    long. The top end is round and the low end blunt (to produce more friction).</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Fire board.</i> Although any board may be used, a seasoned softwood
    board about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) thick and 10 centimeters (4 inches)
    wide is preferable. Cut a depression about 2 centimeters (3/4 inch) from the
    edge on one side of the board. On the underside, make a V-shaped cut from
    the edge of the board to the depression.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Bow.</i> The bow is a resilient, green stick about 2.5 centimeters
    (3/4 inch) in diameter with a bowstring. The type of wood is not important.
    The bowstring can be any type of cordage. Tie the bowstring from one end of
    the bow to the other, without any slack.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><a name="fig7-8"></a><img alt="Figure 7-8. Bow and Drill" src="fig07-08.png" width="350" height="264"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 7-8. Bow and Drill</b></p>
<p>7-30. To use the bow and drill, first prepare the fire lay. Then place a
bundle of tinder under the V-shaped cut in the fire board. Place one foot on the
fire board. Loop the bowstring over the drill and place the drill in the precut
depression on the fire board. Place the socket, held in one hand, on the top of
the drill to hold it in position. Press down on the drill and saw the bow back
and forth to twirl the drill (<a href="#fig7-8">Figure 7-8</a>). Once you have
established a smooth motion, apply more downward pressure and work the bow
faster. This action will grind hot black powder into the tinder, causing a spark
to catch. Blow on the tinder until it ignites.</p>
<p>7-31. Primitive fire-building methods are exhausting and require practice to
ensure success. If your survival situation requires the use of primitive
methods, remember the following hints to help you construct and maintain the
fire:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>If possible, use nonaromatic seasoned hardwood for fuel.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Collect kindling and tinder along the trail.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Add insect repellent to the tinder.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Keep the firewood dry.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Dry damp firewood near the fire.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Bank the fire to keep the coals alive overnight.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Carry lighted punk, when possible.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Be sure the fire is out before leaving camp.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Do not select wood lying on the ground. It may appear to be dry but
    generally doesn't provide enough friction.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Fish and mollusks may be one of your major sources of food. Therefore, it
    is wise to know which ones are dangerous, what the dangers of the various
    fish are, what precautions to take, and what to do if you are injured by one
    of these fish.</p>
    <p>Fish and mollusks will present a danger in one of three ways—by
    attacking and biting you, by injecting toxic venom into you through venomous
    spines or tentacles, and through eating fish or mollusks whose flesh is
    toxic.</p>
    <p>The danger of actually encountering one of these dangerous fish is
    relatively small, but it is still significant. Any one of these fish can
    kill you. Avoid them if at all possible.</p>
  </blockquote>

<h3>FISH THAT ATTACK MAN</h3>
<p>F-1. The shark is usually the first fish that comes to mind when considering
fish that attack man. Other fish also fall in this category, such as the
barracuda, the moray eel, and the piranha.</p>
<p><b>SHARKS</b></p>
<p>F-2. Sharks are potentially the most dangerous fish that attack people. The
obvious danger of sharks is that they are capable of seriously maiming or
killing you with their bite. Of the many shark species, only a relative few are
dangerous. Most cases of shark attacks on humans are by the white, tiger,
hammerhead, and blue sharks. There are also records of attacks by ground, gray
nurse, and mako sharks. <a href="#figf-1">Figure F-1</a>, shows various sharks
and their sizes.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure F-1. Sharks</b></p>
<p>F-3. Avoid sharks if at all possible. Follow the procedures discussed in <a href="16.htm">Chapter
16</a> to defend yourself against a shark attack.</p>
<p>F-4. Sharks vary in size, but there is no relationship between the size of
the shark and likelihood of attack. Even the smaller sharks can be dangerous,
especially when they are traveling in schools.</p>
<p>F-5. If bitten by a shark, the most important measure for you to take is to
stop the bleeding quickly. Blood in the water will attract more sharks. Get
yourself or the victim into a raft or to shore as soon as possible. If in the
water, form a circle around the victim (if not alone), and stop the bleeding
with a tourniquet.</p>
<p><b>OTHER FEROCIOUS FISH</b></p>
<p>F-6. In saltwater, other ferocious fish include the barracuda, sea bass, and
moray eel (<a href="#figf-2">Figure F-2</a>). The sea bass is usually an open
water fish. It is dangerous due to its large size. It can remove large pieces of
flesh from a human. Barracudas and moray eels have been known to attack man and
inflict vicious bites. Be careful of these two species when near reefs and in
shallow water. Moray eels are very aggressive when disturbed.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure F-2. Ferocious Fish</b></p>
<p>F-7. In fresh water, piranha are the only significantly dangerous fish. They
are inhabitants of the tropics and are restricted to northern South America.
These fish are fairly small, about 25 to 60 centimeters (10 to 24 inches), but
they have very large teeth and travel in large schools. They can devour a
full-grown hog in minutes.</p>
<h3>VENOMOUS FISH AND INVERTEBRATES</h3>
<p>F-8. There are several species of venomous fish and invertebrates, all of
which live in saltwater. All of these are capable of injecting poisonous venom
through spines located in their fins, tentacles, or bites. Their venoms cause
intense pain and are potentially fatal. If injured by one of the following fish
or invertebrates, treat the injury as for snakebite.</p>

        actually a colony of sea animals. Mainly found in tropical regions;
        however, the Gulf stream current can carry it as far as Europe. It is

        man-of-war may be as small as 15 centimeters (6 inches), but the

        crevices and coral reefs, and along rocky shores and protected bays in
        tropical areas. All have tiny teeth that are similar to hypodermic
        needles. They can inject an extremely poisonous venom that acts very
        swiftly, causing acute pain, swelling, paralysis, blindness, and
        possible death within hours. Avoid handling all cone shells.</p>

<h3>FISH WITH TOXIC FLESH</h3>
<p>F-9. There are no simple rules to tell edible fish from those with poisonous
flesh. <a href="survival://08.htm#fig8-2">Figure
8-2</a> shows the most common toxic fish. All of these fish contain various
types of poisonous substances or toxins in their flesh and are dangerous to eat.
They have the following common characteristics:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Most live in shallow water around reefs or lagoons.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Many have boxy or round bodies with hard shell-like skins covered with
    bony plates or spines. They have small parrotlike mouths, small gills, and
    small or absent belly fins. Their names suggest their shape.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>F-10. In addition to the above fish and their characteristics, barracuda and
red snapper fish may carry ciguatera, a toxin that accumulates in the systems of
fish that feed on tropical marine reefs.</p>
<p>F-11. Without specific local information, take the following precautions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Be very careful with fish taken from normally shallow lagoons with sandy
    or broken coral bottoms. Reef-feeding species predominate and some may be
    poisonous.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid poisonous fish on the leeward side of an island. This area of
    shallow water consists of patches of living corals mixed with open spaces
    and may extend seaward for some distance. Many different types of fish, some
    poisonous, inhabit these shallow waters.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Do not eat fish caught in any area where the water is unnaturally
    discolored. The discoloration may be indicative of plankton that cause
    various types of toxicity in plankton-feeding fish.</p>
  <li>Try fishing on the windward side or in deep passages leading from the open
    sea to the lagoon, but be careful of currents and waves. Live coral reefs
    drop off sharply into deep water and form a dividing line between the <i>suspected
    fish of the shallows</i> and the <i>desirable deep-water species</i>.
    Deepwater fish are usually not poisonous. You can catch the various toxic
    fish even in deep water. <i>Discard all suspected reef fish,</i> whether
    caught on the ocean or the reef side.</li>
</ul>

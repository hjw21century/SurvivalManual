  <blockquote>
    <p>In a survival situation, you may have to cross a water obstacle. It may
    be in the form of a river, a stream, a lake, a bog, quicksand, quagmire, or
    muskeg. Even in the desert, flash floods occur, making streams an obstacle.
    Whatever the obstacle, you need to know how to cross it safely.</p>
  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="par1">RIVERS AND STREAMS</a></h3>
<p>17-1. You can apply almost every description to rivers and streams. They may
be shallow or deep, slow or fast moving, narrow or wide. Before you try to cross
a river or stream, develop a good plan.</p>
<p>17-2. Your first step is to look for a high place from which you can get a
good view of the river or stream. From this place, you can look for a place to
cross. If there is no high place, climb a tree. Good crossing locations
include—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>A level stretch where it breaks into several channels. Two or three
    narrow channels are usually easier to cross than a wide river.</p>
  <li>
    <p>A shallow bank or sandbar. If possible, select a point upstream from the
    bank or sandbar so that the current will carry you to it if you lose your
    footing.</p>
  <li>
    <p>A course across the river that leads downstream so that you will cross
    the current at about a 45-degree angle.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>17-3. The following areas possess potential hazards; avoid them, if possible:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Obstacles on the opposite side of the river that might hinder your
    travel. Try to select the spot from which travel will be the safest and
    easiest.</p>
  <li>
    <p>A ledge of rocks that crosses the river. This often indicates dangerous
    rapids or canyons.</p>
  <li>
    <p>A deep or rapid waterfall or a deep channel. Never try to ford a stream
    directly above or even close to such hazards.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Rocky places that could cause you to sustain serious injuries from
    slipping or falling. Usually, submerged rocks are very slick, making balance
    extremely difficult. An occasional rock that breaks the current, however,
    may help you.</p>
  <li>
    <p>An estuary of a river because it is normally wide, has strong currents,
    and is subject to tides. These tides can influence some rivers many
    kilometers from their mouths. Go back upstream to an easier crossing site.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Eddies, which can produce a powerful backward pull downstream of the
    obstruction causing the eddy and pull you under the surface.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>17-4. The depth of a fordable river or stream is no deterrent if you can keep
your footing. In fact, deep water sometimes runs more slowly and is therefore
safer than fast-moving shallow water. You can always dry your clothes later, or
if necessary, you can make a raft to carry your clothing and equipment across
the river.</p>
<p>17-5. You must not try to swim or wade across a stream or river when the
water is at very low temperatures. This swim could be fatal. Try to make a raft
of some type. Wade across if you can get only your feet wet. Dry them vigorously
as soon as you reach the other bank.</p>
<h3><a name="par2">RAPIDS</a></h3>
<p>17-6. If necessary, you can safely cross a deep, swift river or rapids. To
swim across a deep, swift river, swim with the current, never fight it. Try to
keep your body horizontal to the water. This will reduce the danger of being
pulled under.</p>
<p>17-7. In fast, shallow rapids, lie on your back, feet pointing downstream,
finning your hands alongside your hips. This action will increase buoyancy and
help you steer away from obstacles. Keep your feet up to avoid getting them
bruised or caught by rocks.</p>
<p>17-8. In deep rapids, lie on your stomach, head downstream, angling toward
the shore whenever you can. Watch for obstacles and be careful of backwater
eddies and converging currents, as they often contain dangerous swirls.
Converging currents occur where new watercourses enter the river or where water
has been diverted around large obstacles such as small islands.</p>
<p>17-9. To ford a swift, treacherous stream, apply the following steps:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Remove your pants and shirt to lessen the water's pull on you. Keep your
    footgear on to protect your feet and ankles from rocks. It will also provide
    you with firmer footing.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Tie your pants and other articles to the top of your rucksack or in a
    bundle, if you have no pack. This way, if you have to release your
    equipment, all your articles will be together. It is easier to find one
    large pack than to find several small items.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Carry your pack well up on your shoulders and be sure you can easily
    remove it, if necessary. Not being able to get a pack off quickly enough can
    drag even the strongest swimmers under.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Find a strong pole about 7.5 centimeters (3 inches) in diameter and 2.1
    to 2.4 meters (7 to 8 feet) long to help you ford the stream. Grasp the pole
    and plant it firmly on your upstream side to break the current. Plant your
    feet firmly with each step, and move the pole forward a little downstream
    from its previous position, but still upstream from you. With your next
    step, place your foot below the pole. Keep the pole well slanted so that the
    force of the current keeps the pole against your shoulder (<a href="#fig17-1">Figure
    17-1</a>).</p>
  <li>
    <p>Cross the stream so that you will cross the downstream current at a
    45-degree angle.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><a name="fig17-1"></a><img alt="Figure 17-1. One Man Crossing Swift Stream" src="fig17-01.png" width="350" height="131"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 17-1. One Man Crossing Swift Stream</b></p>
<p>17-10. Using this method, you can safely cross currents usually too strong
for one person to stand against. Do not concern yourself about your pack's
weight, as the weight will help rather than hinder you in fording the stream.</p>
<p>17-11. If there are other people with you, cross the stream together. Ensure
that everyone has prepared their pack and clothing as outlined above. Position
the heaviest person on the downstream end of the pole and the lightest on the
upstream end. In using this method, the upstream person breaks the current, and
those below can move with relative ease in the eddy formed by the upstream
person. If the upstream person gets temporarily swept off his feet, the others
can hold steady while he regains his footing (<a href="#fig17-2">Figure 17-2</a>).</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 17-2. Several Men Crossing Swift Stream</b></p>
<p>17-12. If you have three or more people and a rope available, you can use the
technique shown in <a href="#fig17-3">Figure 17-3</a> to cross the stream. The
length of the rope must be three times the width of the stream.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig17-3"></a><img alt="Figure 17-3. Individuals Tied Together to Cross Stream" src="fig17-03.png" width="350" height="448"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 17-3. Individuals Tied Together to Cross Stream</b></p>
<h3><a name="par3">RAFTS</a></h3>
<p>17-13. If you have two ponchos, you can construct a brush raft or an
Australian poncho raft. With either of these rafts, you can safely float your
equipment across a slow-moving stream or river.</p>
<p><b>BRUSH RAFT</b></p>
<p>17-14. The brush raft, if properly constructed, will support about 115
kilograms (253 pounds). To construct it, use ponchos, fresh green brush, two
small saplings, and rope or vine as follows (<a href="#fig17-4">Figure 17-4</a>):</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Push the hood of each poncho to the inner side and tightly tie off the
    necks using the drawstrings.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Attach the ropes or vines at the corner and side grommets of each poncho.
    Make sure they are long enough to cross to and tie with the others attached
    at the opposite corner or side.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Spread one poncho on the ground with the inner side up. Pile fresh, green
    brush (no thick branches) on the poncho until the brush stack is about 45
    centimeters (18 inches) high. Pull the drawstring up through the center of
    the brush stack.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Make an X-frame from two small saplings and place it on top of the brush
    stack. Tie the X-frame securely in place with the poncho drawstring.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Pile another 45 centimeters (18 inches) of brush on top of the X-frame,
    then compress the brush slightly.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Pull the poncho sides up around the brush and, using the ropes or vines
    attached to the corner or side grommets, tie them diagonally from corner to
    corner and from side to side.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Spread the second poncho, inner side up, next to the brush bundle.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Roll the brush bundle onto the second poncho so that the tied side is
    down. Tie the second poncho around the brush bundle in the same manner as
    you tied the first poncho around the brush.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place it in the water with the tied side of the second poncho facing up.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><a name="fig17-4"></a><img alt="Figure 17-4. Brush Raft" src="fig17-04.png" width="350" height="165"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 17-4. Brush Raft</b></p>
<p><b>AUSTRALIAN PONCHO RAFT</b></p>
<p>17-15. If you do not have time to gather brush for a brush raft, you can make
an Australian poncho raft. This raft, although more waterproof than the poncho
brush raft, will only float about 35 kilograms (77 pounds) of equipment. To
construct this raft, use two ponchos, two rucksacks, two 1.2-meter (4-foot)
poles or branches, and ropes, vines, bootlaces, or comparable material as
follows (<a href="#fig17-5">Figure 17-5</a>):</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Push the hood of each poncho to the inner side and tightly tie off the
    necks using the drawstrings.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Spread one poncho on the ground with the inner side up. Place and center
    the two 1.2-meter (4-foot) poles on the poncho about 45 centimeters (18
    inches) apart.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place your rucksacks, packs, or other equipment between the poles. Also,
    place other items that you want to keep dry between the poles. Snap the
    poncho sides together.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Use your buddy's help to complete the raft. Hold the snapped portion of
    the poncho in the air and roll it tightly down to the equipment. Make sure
    you roll the full width of the poncho.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Twist the ends of the roll to form pigtails in opposite directions. Fold
    the pigtails over the bundle and tie them securely in place using ropes,
    bootlaces, or vines.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Spread the second poncho on the ground, inner side up. If you need more
    buoyancy, place some fresh green brush on this poncho.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place the equipment bundle, tied side down, on the center of the second
    poncho. Wrap the second poncho around the equipment bundle following the
    same procedure you used for wrapping the equipment in the first poncho.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Tie ropes, bootlaces, vines, or other binding material around the raft
    about 30 centimeters (12 inches) from the end of each pigtail. Place and
    secure weapons on top of the raft.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Tie one end of a rope to an empty canteen and the other end to the raft.
    This will help you to tow the raft.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><a name="fig17-5"></a><img alt="Figure 17-5. Australian Poncho Raft" src="fig17-05.png" width="350" height="161"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 17-5. Australian Poncho Raft</b></p>
<p><b>PONCHO DONUT RAFT</b></p>
<p>17-16. Another type of raft is the poncho donut raft. It takes more time to
construct than the brush raft or Australian poncho raft, but it is effective. To
construct it, use one poncho, small saplings, willow or vines, and rope,
bootlaces, or other binding material (<a href="#fig17-6">Figure 17-6</a>) as
follows:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Make a framework circle by placing several stakes in the ground that
    roughly outline an inner and outer circle.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Using young saplings, willow, or vines, construct a donut ring within the
    circles of stakes.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Wrap several pieces of cordage around the donut ring about 30 to 60
    centimeters (12 to 24 inches) apart and tie them securely.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Push the poncho's hood to the inner side and tightly tie off the neck
    using the drawstring.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place the poncho on the ground, inner side up. Place the donut ring on
    the center of the poncho. Wrap the poncho up and over the donut ring and tie
    off each grommet on the poncho to the ring.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Tie one end of a rope to an empty canteen and the other end to the raft.
    This rope will help you to tow the raft.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><a name="fig17-6"></a><img alt="Figure 17-6. Poncho Donut Raft" src="fig17-06.png" width="350" height="131"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 17-6. Poncho Donut Raft</b></p>
<p>17-17. When launching any of the above rafts, take care not to puncture or
tear it by dragging it on the ground. Before you start to cross the river or
stream, let the raft lay on the water a few minutes to ensure that it floats.</p>
<p>17-18. If the river is too deep to ford, push the raft in front of you while
you are swimming. The design of the above rafts does not allow them to carry a
person's full body weight. Use them as a float to get you and your equipment
safely across the river or stream.</p>
<p>17-19. Be sure to check the water temperature before trying to cross a river
or water obstacle. If the water is extremely cold and you are unable to find a
shallow fording place in the river, do not try to ford it. Devise other means
for crossing. For instance, you might improvise a bridge by felling a tree over
the river. Or you might build a raft large enough to carry you and your
equipment. For this, however, you will need an axe, a knife, a rope or vines,
and time.</p>
<p><b>LOG RAFT</b></p>
<p>17-20. You can make a raft using any dry, dead, standing trees for logs.
However, spruce trees found in polar and subpolar regions make the best rafts. A
simple method for making a raft is to use pressure bars lashed securely at each
end of the raft to hold the logs together (<a href="#fig17-7">Figure 17-7</a>).</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig17-7"></a><img alt="Figure 17-7. Use of Pressure Bars" src="fig17-07.png" width="350" height="156"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 17-7. Use of Pressure Bars</b></p>
<h3><a name="par4">FLOTATION DEVICES</a></h3>
<p>17-21. If the water is warm enough for swimming and you do not have the time
or materials to construct one of the poncho-type rafts, you can use various
flotation devices to negotiate the water obstacle. Some items you can use for
flotation devices are—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p><i>Trousers.</i> Knot each trouser leg at the bottom and close the fly.
    With both hands, grasp the waistband at the sides and swing the trousers in
    the air to trap air in each leg. Quickly press the sides of the waistband
    together and hold it underwater so that the air will not escape. You now
    have water wings to keep you afloat as you cross the body of water.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Wet the trousers before inflating to trap the air better You may
have to reinflate the trousers several times when crossing a large body of
water.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p><i>Empty containers. </i>Lash together empty gas cans, water jugs, ammo
    cans, boxes, or other items that will trap or hold air. Use them as water
    wings. Use this type of flotation device only in a slow-moving river or
    stream.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Plastic bags and ponchos. </i>Fill two or more plastic bags with air
    and secure them together at the opening. Use your poncho and roll green
    vegetation tightly inside it so that you have a roll at least 20 centimeters
    (8 inches) in diameter. Tie the ends of the roll securely. You can wear it
    around your waist or across one shoulder and under the opposite arm.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Logs. </i>Use a stranded drift log if one is available, or find a log
    near the water to use as a float. Be sure to test the log before starting to
    cross. Some tree logs—palm, for example—will sink even when the wood is
    dead. Another method is to tie two logs about 60 centimeters (24 inches)
    apart. Sit between the logs with your back against one and your legs over
    the other (<a href="#fig17-8">Figure 17-8</a>).</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Cattails. </i>Gather stalks of cattails and tie them in a bundle 25
    centimeters (10 inches) or more in diameter. The many air cells in each
    stalk cause a stalk to float until it rots. Test the cattail bundle to be
    sure it will support your weight before trying to cross a body of water.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><a name="fig17-8"></a><img alt="Figure 17-8. Log Flotation" src="fig17-08.png" width="350" height="146"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 17-8. Log Flotation</b></p>
<p>17-22. There are many other flotation devices that you can devise by using
some imagination. Just make sure to test the device before trying to use it.</p>
<h3><a name="par5">OTHER WATER OBSTACLES</a></h3>
<p>17-23. Other water obstacles that you may face are bogs, quagmire, muskeg, or
quicksand. Do not try to walk across these. Trying to lift your feet while
standing upright will make you sink deeper. Try to bypass these obstacles. If
you are unable to bypass them, you may be able to bridge them using logs,
branches, or foliage.</p>
<p>17-24. A way to cross a bog is to lie face down, with your arms and legs
spread. Use a flotation device or form pockets of air in your clothing. Swim or
pull your way across moving slowly and trying to keep your body horizontal.</p>
<p>17-25. In swamps, the areas that have vegetation are usually firm enough to
support your weight. However, vegetation will usually not be present in open mud
or water areas. If you are an average swimmer, you should have no problem
swimming, crawling, or pulling your way through miles of bog or swamp.</p>
<p>17-26. Quicksand is a mixture of sand and water that forms a shifting mass.
It yields easily to pressure and sucks down and engulfs objects resting on its
surface. It varies in depth and is usually localized. Quicksand commonly occurs
on flat shores, in silt-choked rivers with shifting watercourses, and near the
mouths of large rivers. If you are uncertain whether a sandy area is quicksand,
toss a small stone on it. The stone will sink in quicksand. Although quicksand
has more suction than mud or muck, you can cross it just as you would cross a
bog. Lie face down, spread your arms and legs, and move slowly across.</p>
<h3><a name="par6">VEGETATION OBSTACLES</a></h3>
<p>17-27. Some water areas you must cross may have underwater and floating
plants that will make swimming difficult. However, you can swim through
relatively dense vegetation if you remain calm and do not thrash about. Stay as
near the surface as possible and use the breaststroke with shallow leg and arm
motion. Remove the plants around you as you would clothing. When you get tired,
float or swim on your back until you have rested enough to continue with the
breaststroke.</p>
<p>17-28. The mangrove swamp is another type of obstacle that occurs along
tropical coastlines. Mangrove trees or shrubs throw out many prop roots that
form dense masses. To get through a mangrove swamp, wait for low tide. If you
are on the inland side, look for a narrow grove of trees and work your way
seaward through these. You can also try to find the bed of a waterway or creek
through the trees and follow it to the sea. If you are on the seaward side, work
inland along streams or channels. Be on the lookout for crocodiles along
channels and in shallow water. If there are any near you, leave the water and
scramble over the mangrove roots. While crossing a mangrove swamp, it is
possible to gather food from tidal pools or tree roots.</p>
<p>17-29. A large swamp area requires more time and effort. Therefore, if you <b>must</b>
cross a large swamp area, construct some type of raft.</p>

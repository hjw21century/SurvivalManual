    <p>If you fear snakes, it is probably because you are unfamiliar with them

    <p>For a man wearing shoes and trousers and living in a camp, the danger of
    being bitten by a venomous snake is small compared to the hazards of
    malaria, cholera, dysentery, or other diseases.</p>
    <p>Nearly all snakes avoid man if possible. A few—the king cobra of
    Southeast Asia, the bushmaster and tropical rattlesnake of South America,
    and the mamba of Africa—may aggressively attack man, but even these snakes
    do so only occasionally. Most snakes get out of the way and are seldom seen.</p>
  </blockquote>

<h3>WAYS TO AVOID SNAKEBITE</h3>
<p>E-1. Snakes are widely distributed. They are found in all tropical,
subtropical, and most temperate regions. Some species of snakes have specialized
glands that contain a toxic venom, and long, hollow fangs to inject their venom.</p>
<p>E-2. Although venomous snakes use their venom to secure food, they also use
it for self-defense. Human accidents occur when you don't see or hear the snake,
when you step on them, or when you walk too close to them.</p>
<p>E-3. Follow these simple rules to reduce the chance of accidental snakebite:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Don't sleep next to brush, tall grass, large boulders, or trees. They
    provide hiding places for snakes. Place your sleeping bag in a clearing. Use
    mosquito netting tucked well under the bag. This netting should provide a
    good barrier.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Don't put your hands into dark places, such as rock crevices, heavy
    brush, or hollow logs, without first investigating.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Don't step over a fallen tree. Step on the log and look to see if there
    is a snake resting on the other side.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Don't walk through heavy brush or tall grass without looking down. Look
    where you are walking.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Don't pick up any snake unless you are absolutely positive it is not
    venomous.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Don't pick up freshly killed snakes without first severing the head. The
    nervous system may still be active and a dead snake can deliver a bite.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>SNAKE GROUPS</h3>
<p>E-4. Snakes dangerous to man usually fall into two groups: proteroglypha and
solenoglypha. Their fangs and their venom best describe these two groups (<a href="#fige-1">Figure
E-1</a>).</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fige-1"></a><img alt="Figure E-1. Snake Group Characteristics" src="fige-1.png" width="413" height="83"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure E-1. Snake Group Characteristics</b></p>
<p><b>FANGS</b></p>
<p>E-5. The proteroglypha have, in front of the upper jaw and preceding the
ordinary teeth, permanently erect fangs. These fangs are called fixed fangs.</p>
<p>E-6. The solenoglypha have erectile fangs; that is, fangs they can raise to
an erect position. These fangs are called folded fangs.</p>
<p><b>VENOM</b></p>
<p>E-7. The fixed-fang snakes (proteroglypha) usually have neurotoxic venoms.
These venoms affect the nervous system, making the victim unable to breathe.</p>
<p>E-8. The folded-fang snakes (solenoglypha) usually have hemotoxic venoms.
These venoms affect the circulatory system, destroying blood cells, damaging
skin tissues, and causing internal hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>E-9. Remember, however, that most venomous snakes have both neurotoxic and
hemotoxic venom. Usually one type of venom in the snake is dominant and the
other is weak.</p>
<p><b>VENOMOUS VERSUS NONVENOMOUS SNAKES</b></p>
<p>E-10. No single characteristic distinguishes a venomous snake from a harmless
one except the presence of poison fangs and glands. Only in dead specimens can
you determine the presence of these fangs and glands without danger.</p>
<h3>DESCRIPTIONS OF VENOMOUS SNAKES</h3>
<p>E-11. There are many different venomous snakes throughout the world. It is
unlikely you will see many except in a zoo. This manual describes only a few
venomous snakes. However, you should be able to spot a venomous snake if you—</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure E-3. Snake Families (Continued)</b></p>
<p><b>VIPERIDAE</b></p>
<p>E-12. The viperidae, or true vipers, usually have thick bodies and heads that
are much wider than their necks (<a href="#fige-4">Figure E-4</a>). However,
there are many different sizes, markings, and colorations.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fige-4"></a><img alt="Figure E-4. Positive Identification of Vipers" src="image271.jpg" width="350" height="221"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure E-4. Positive Identification of Vipers</b></p>
<p>E-13. This snake group has developed a highly sophisticated means for
delivering venom. They have long, hollow fangs that perform like hypodermic
needles. They deliver their venom deep into the wound.</p>
<p>E-14. The fangs of this group of snakes are movable. These snakes fold their
fangs into the roof of their mouths. When they strike, their fangs come forward,
stabbing the victim. The snake controls the movement of its fangs; fang movement
is not automatic. The venom is usually hemotoxic. However, there are several
species that have large quantities of neurotoxic elements, thus making them even
more dangerous. The vipers are responsible for many human fatalities around the
world.</p>
<p><b>CROTALIDAE</b></p>
<p>E-15. The crotalids, or pit vipers (<a href="#fige-5">Figure E-5</a>), may be
either slender or thick-bodied. Their heads are usually much wider than their
necks. These snakes take their name from the deep pit located between the eye
and the nostril. They are usually brown with dark blotches but some kinds are
green.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fige-5"></a><img alt="Figure E-5 Positive Identification of Pit Vipers" src="image272.jpg" width="350" height="178"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure E-5 Positive Identification of Pit Vipers</b></p>
<p>E-16. Rattlesnakes, copperheads, cottonmouths, and several species of
dangerous snakes from Central and South America, Asia, China, and India fall
into the pit viper group. The pit is a highly sensitive organ capable of picking
up the slightest temperature variance. Most pit vipers are nocturnal. They hunt
for food at night with the aid of these specialized pits that let them locate
prey in total darkness. Rattlesnakes are the only pit vipers that possess a
rattle at the tip of the tail.</p>
<p>E-17. India has about twelve species of these snakes. You find them in trees
or on the ground in all types of terrain. The tree snakes are slender; the
ground snakes are heavy-bodied. All are dangerous.</p>
<p>E-18. China has a pit viper similar to the cottonmouth found in North
America. You find it in the rocky areas of the remote mountains of South China.
It reaches a length of 1.4 meters<br>
(5 feet) but is not vicious unless irritated. You can also find a small pit
viper, about 45 centimeters (18 inches) long, on the plains of eastern China. It
is too small to be dangerous to a man wearing shoes.</p>
<p>E-19. There are about twenty-seven species of rattlesnakes in the United
States and Mexico. They vary in color and may or may not have spots or blotches.
Some are small but others, such as the diamondbacks, may grow to 2.5 meters (8
feet) long.</p>
<p>E-20. There are five kinds of rattlesnakes in Central and South America, but
only the tropical rattlesnake is widely distributed. The rattle on the tip of
the tail is sufficient identification for a rattlesnake.</p>
<p>E-21. Most will try to escape without a fight when approached, but there is
always a chance one will strike at a passerby. They do not always give a
warning; they may strike first and rattle afterwards or not at all.</p>
<p>E-22. The genus <i>Trimeresurus</i> is a subgroup of the crotalidae. These
are Asian pit vipers. They are normally tree-loving snakes, but some live on the
ground. They basically have the same characteristics of the crotalidae—slender
build and very dangerous. Their bites usually are on the upper
extremities—head, neck, and shoulders. Their venom is largely hemotoxic.</p>
<p><b>ELAPIDAE</b></p>
<p>E-23. Elapidae are a group of highly dangerous snakes with a powerful
neurotoxic venom that affects the nervous system, causing respiratory paralysis.
Included in this family are coral snakes, cobras, mambas, and all the Australian
venomous snakes. The coral snake is small and has caused human fatalities. The
Australian death adder, tiger, taipan, and king brown snakes are among the most
venomous in the world, causing many human fatalities.</p>
<p>E-24. Only by examining a dead snake can you positively determine if it is a
cobra or a near relative (<a href="#fige-6">Figure E-6</a>). On cobras, kraits,
and coral snakes, the third scale on the upper lip touches both the nostril
scale and the eye. The krait also has a row of enlarged scales down its ridged
back.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fige-6"></a><img alt="Figure E-6. Positive Identification of Cobras, Kraits,and Coral Snakes" src="image273.jpg" width="350" height="202"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure E-6. Positive Identification of Cobras, Kraits,and
Coral Snakes</b></p>
<p>E-25. You can find the cobras of Africa and the Near East in almost any
habitat. One kind may live in or near water, another in trees. Some are
aggressive and savage. The distance a cobra can strike in a forward direction is
equal to the distance its head is raised above the ground. Some cobras, however,
can spit venom a distance of 3 to 3.5 meters (10 to 12 feet). This venom is
harmless unless it gets into your eyes; then it may cause blindness if not
washed out immediately. Poking around in holes and rock piles is dangerous
because of the chance of encountering a spitting cobra.</p>
<p><b>LATICAUDIDAE AND HYDROPHIDAE</b></p>
<p>E-26. A subfamily of elapidae, these snakes are specialized in that they
found a better environment in the oceans. Why they are in the oceans is not
clear to scientists.</p>
<p>E-27. Sea snakes differ in appearance from other snakes in that they have an
oarlike tail to aid in swimming. Some species of sea<br>
nakes have venom several times more toxic than the cobra's. Because of their
marine environment, sea snakes seldom come in contact with humans. The
exceptions are fisherman who capture these dangerous snakes in fishnets and
scuba divers who swim in waters where sea snakes are found.</p>
<p>E-28. There are many species of sea snakes. They vary greatly in color and
shape. Their scales distinguish them from eels that have no scales.</p>
<p>E-29. Sea snakes occur in salt water along the coasts throughout the Pacific.
There are also sea snakes on the east coast of<br>
Africa and in the Persian Gulf. There are no sea snakes in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>E-30. There is no need to fear sea snakes. They have not been known to attack
a man swimming. Fishermen occasionally get bitten by a sea snake caught in a
net. The bite is dangerous.</p>
<p><b>COLUBRIDAE</b></p>
<p>E-31. The colubridae is the largest group of snakes worldwide. In this family
there are species that are rear-fanged; however, most are completely harmless to
man. They have a venom-producing gland and enlarged, grooved rear fangs that
allow venom to flow into the wound. The inefficient venom apparatus and the
specialized venom is effective on cold-blooded animals (such as frogs and
lizards) but not considered a threat to human life. However, the boomslang and
the twig snake of Africa have caused human deaths.</p>
<h3>LIZARDS</h3>
<p>E-32. There is little to fear from lizards as long as you follow the same
precautions as for avoiding snakebite. There are only two poisonous lizards: the
Gila monster and the Mexican beaded lizard. The venom of both these lizards is
neurotoxic. The two lizards are in the same family, and both are slow moving
with a docile nature.</p>
<p>E-33. The komodo dragon <i>(Varanus komodoensis),</i> although not poisonous,
can be dangerous due to its large size. These lizards can reach lengths of 3
meters (10 feet) and weigh over 115 kilograms (253 pounds). Do not try to
capture this lizard.</p>

<p><b>American copperhead<br>
</b><i>Agkistrodon contortrix</i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> Chestnut color dominates overall, with darker crossbands
of rich browns that become narrower on top and widen at the bottom. The top of
the head is a coppery color.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Very common over much of its range, with a natural
camouflage ability to blend in the environment. Copperheads are rather quiet and
inoffensive in disposition but will defend themselves vigorously. Bites occur
when the snakes are stepped on or when a victim is lying next to one. A
copperhead lying on a bed of dead leaves becomes invisible. Its venom is
hemotoxic.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found in wooded and rocky areas and mountainous regions.</p>
<p><b>Length:</b> Average 60 centimeters (24 inches), maximum (47 inches) 120
centimeters.</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Kansas, Ohio, most of the
southeast United States, and along the Atlantic coast from north Florida to
Massachusetts (<a href="#fige-7">Figure E-7</a>).</p>

<p><b>Bushmaster<br>
</b><i>Lachesis muta</i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="image276.jpg" width="350" height="237"></p>
<p><b>Description:</b> The body hue is rather pale brown or pinkish, with a
series of large bold dark brown or black blotches extending along the body. Its
scales are extremely rough.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> The world's largest pit viper has a bad reputation.
This huge venomous snake is not common anywhere in its range. It lives in remote
and isolated habitats and is largely nocturnal in its feeding habits. It seldom
bites anyone, so few bites are recorded. A bite from one would indeed be very
serious and fatal if medical aid was not immediately available. Usually, the
bites occur in remote, dense jungles, many kilometers and several hours or even
days away from medical help. Bushmaster fangs are long. In large bushmasters,
they can measure 3.8 centimeters (1 3/4 inches). Its venom is a powerful
hemotoxin.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found chiefly in tropical forests in their range.</p>
<p><b>Length: </b>Average 2.1 meters (7 feet), maximum 3.7 meters (12 feet).</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Northern South America and parts of Central America,
including Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Trinidad, and Brazil (<a href="#fige-8">Figure

<p><b>Coral snake<br>
</b><i>Micrurus fulvius</i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> Beautifully marked with bright blacks, reds, and yellows.
To identify the species, remember that when red touches yellow it is a coral
snake.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Common over range, but secretive in its habits,
therefore seldom seen. It has short fangs that are fixed in an erect position.
It often chews to release its venom into a wound. Its venom is very powerful.
The venom is neurotoxic, causing respiratory paralysis in the victim, who
succumbs to suffocation.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found in a variety of habitats including wooded areas,
swamps, palmetto and scrub areas. Coral snakes often venture into residential
locations.</p>
<p><b>Length:</b> Average 60 centimeters (24 inches), maximum 115 centimeters
(45 inches).</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Southeast United States and west to Texas. Another genus
of coral snake is found in Arizona. Coral snakes are also found throughout
Central and most of South America (<a href="#fige-9">Figure E-9</a>).</p>

<p><b>Cottonmouth</b><br>
<i>Agkistrodon piscivorus</i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> Colors are variable. Adults are uniformly olive brown or
black. The young and subadults are strongly crossbanded with dark brown.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> These dangerous semiaquatic snakes closely resemble
harmless water snakes that have the same habitat. Therefore, it is best to leave
all water snakes alone. Cottonmouths often stand their ground. An aroused
cottonmouth will draw its head close to its body and open its mouth, showing its
white interior. Cottonmouth venom is hemotoxic and potent. Bites are prone to
gangrene.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found in swamps, lakes, rivers, and ditches.</p>
<p><b>Length:</b> Average 90 centimeters (35 inches), maximum 1.8 meters (6
feet).</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Most of southeast United States, particularly southeast
Virginia, west central Alabama, south Georgia, Illinois, east central Kentucky,
south central Oklahoma, Texas, North and South Carolina, and Florida (including
the Florida Keys) (<a href="#fige-10">Figure E-10</a>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> Dark brown or black, outlined by a row of cream or
yellowish scales. Ground color is olive to brown.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> The largest venomous snake in the United States.
Large snakes can have fangs that measure 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in a straight
line. This species has a sullen disposition, ready to defend itself when
threatened. Its venom is potent and hemotoxic, causing great pain and damage to
tissue.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found in palmettos and scrubs, swamps, pine woods, and
flatwoods. It has been observed swimming many miles out in the Gulf of Mexico,
reaching some of the islands off the Florida coast.</p>
<p><b>Length:</b> Average 1.4 meters (5 feet), maximum 2.4 meters (8 feet).</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Coastal areas of North Carolina, South Carolina,

<p><b>Eyelash pit viper<br>
</b><i>Bothrops schlegeli</i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> Identified by several spiny scales over each eye. Color
is highly variable, from bright yellow over its entire body to reddish-yellow
spots throughout the body.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Arboreal snake that seldom comes to the ground. It
feels more secure in low-hanging trees where it looks for tree frogs and birds.
It is a dangerous species because most of its bites occur on the upper
extremities. It has an irritable disposition. It will strike with little
provocation. Its venom is hemotoxic, causing severe tissue damage. Deaths have
occurred from the bites of these snakes.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Tree-loving species found in rain forests; common on
plantations and in palm trees.</p>
<p><b>Length:</b> Average 45 centimeters (18 inches), maximum 75 centimeters (30
inches).</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Southern Mexico, throughout Central America, Columbia,

<p><b>Fer-de-lance<br>
</b><i>Bothrops atrox</i><br>
<p>There are several closely related species in this group. All are very
dangerous to man.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> Variable coloration, from gray to olive, brown, or
reddish, with dark triangles edged with light scales. Triangles are narrow at
the top and wide at the bottom.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> This highly dangerous snake is responsible for a high
mortality rate. It has an irritable disposition, ready to strike with little
provocation. The female fer-de-lance is highly prolific, producing up to 60
young, all with a dangerous bite. The venom of this species is hemotoxic,
painful, and hemorrhagic (causing profuse internal bleeding). The venom causes
massive tissue destruction.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found on cultivated land and farms, often entering houses in
search of rodents.</p>
<p><b>Length:</b> Average 1.4 meters (5 feet), maximum 2.4 meters (8 feet).</p>

<i>Bothrops nummifer</i><br>
<p><b>Description:</b> It has a stocky body. Its ground color varies from brown
to gray and it has dark brown or black dorsal blotches. It has no pattern on its
head.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> It is chiefly a nocturnal snake. It comes out in the
early evening hours to feed on lizards, rodents, and frogs. As the name implies,
this species can strike with force as it actually leaves the ground. Its venom
is hemotoxic. Humans have died from the bites inflicted by large jumping vipers.
They often hide under fallen logs and piles of leaves and are difficult to see.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found in rain forests, on plantations, and on wooded
hillsides.</p>
<p><b>Length:</b> Average 60 centimeters (24 inches), maximum 120 centimeters

darker diamond-shaped markings bordered by lighter-colored scales and black
bands around the tail.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Although this rattlesnake is of moderate size, its
bite is very serious. Its venom has quantities of neurotoxic elements that

rhombs or diamonds bordered by a buff color.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Extremely dangerous with an irritable disposition,
ready to strike with little or no warning (use of its rattle). This species has
a highly toxic venom containing neurotoxic and hemotoxic components that

<p><b>Horned desert viper</b><br>
<i>Cerastes cerastes</i><br>
<p><b>Description:</b> Pale buff color with obscure markings and a sharp spine
(scale) over each eye.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> As with all true vipers that live in the desert, it
finds refuge by burrowing in the heat of the day, coming out at night to feed.
It is difficult to detect when buried; therefore, many bites result from the
snake being accidentally stepped on. Its venom is hemotoxic, causing severe
damage to blood cells and tissue.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Only found in very arid places within its range.</p>
<p><b>Length:</b> Average 45 centimeters (18 inches), maximum 75 centimeters (30

<p><b>King cobra</b><br>
<i>Ophiophagus hannah</i><br>
<p><b>Description:</b> Uniformly olive, brown, or green with ringlike crossbands
of black.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Although it is the largest venomous snake in the
world and it has a disposition to go with this honor, it causes relatively few
bites on humans. It appears to have a degree of intelligence. It avoids
attacking another venomous snake for fear of being bitten. It feeds exclusively
on harmless species. The female builds a nest then deposits her eggs. Lying
close by, she guards the nest and is highly aggressive toward anything that
closely approaches the nest. The venom is a powerful neurotoxin. Without medical
aid, death is certain for its victims.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Dense jungle and cultivated fields.</p>
<p><b>Length:</b> Average 3.5 meters (12 feet), maximum 5.5 meters (18 feet).</p>

<p><b>Characteristics:</b> Kraits are found only in Asia. This snake is of
special concern to man. It is deadly—about 15 times more deadly than the
common cobra. It is active at night and relatively passive during the day. The
native people often step on kraits while walking through their habitats. The
krait has a tendency to seek shelter in sleeping bags, boots, and tents. Its
venom is a powerful neurotoxin that causes respiratory failure.</p>
<p><b>Habitat:</b> Open fields, human settlements, and dense jungle.</p>
<p><b>Length:</b> Average 90 centimeters (35 inches), maximum 1.5 meters (5

triangular-shaped, brown markings bordered with light-colored scales. The base
of the triangular-shaped markings end at the midline. It has dark brown,
arrow-shaped markings on the top and each side of its head.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b> This snake has long fangs, is ill-tempered, and is
responsible for many bites. Its venom is hemotoxic, destroying blood cells and
tissue, but a victim's chances of survival are good with medical aid. This viper
is a ground dweller that moves into many areas in search of food. The greatest
danger is in stepping on the snake with bare feet.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics:</b> A viper that does not look like one. It is small in
size, and its small head does not indicate the presence of venom glands. It has
a rather inoffensive disposition; however, it will quickly turn and bite if
restrained or touched. Its hemotoxic venom is potent for such a small snake. Its
fangs are exceptionally long. A bite can result even when picking it up behind
the head. It is best to leave this snake alone.</p>

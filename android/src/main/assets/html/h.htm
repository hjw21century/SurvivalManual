  <blockquote>
    <p>About 200 years ago an Englishman classified clouds according to what
    they looked like to a person seeing them from the ground. He grouped them
    into three classes and gave them Latin names: cirrus, cumulus, and stratus.
    These three names, alone and combined with other Latin words, are still used
    to identify different cloud formations.</p>
    <p>By being familiar with the different cloud formation and what weather
    they portend, you can take appropriate action for your protection.</p>

        <p><b>Cirrus clouds</b><br>
        <p>Cirrus clouds are the very high clouds that look like thin streaks or
        curls. They are usually 6 kilometers (4 miles) or more above the earth
        and are usually a sign of fair weather. In cold climates, however,
        cirrus clouds that begin to multiply and are accompanied by increasing
        winds blowing steadily from a northerly direction indicate an oncoming
        blizzard.</p>

        <img src="h2.jpg" width="483" height="241">
        <p><b>Cumulus clouds</b><br>
        <p>Cumulus clouds are fluffy, white, heaped-up clouds. These clouds,
        which are much lower than cirrus clouds, are often fair weather clouds.
        They are apt to appear around midday on a sunny day, looking like large
        cotton balls with flat bottoms. As the day advances, they may become
        bigger and push higher into the atmosphere, piling up to appear like a
        mountain of clouds. These can turn into storm clouds.</p>

        <img src="h3.jpg" width="487" height="243">
        <p><b>Stratus clouds</b><br>
        <p>Stratus clouds are very low, gray clouds, often making an even gray
        layer over the whole sky. These clouds generally mean rain.</p>

        <img src="h4.jpg" width="487" height="242">
        <p><b>Nimbus clouds</b><br>
        <p>Nimbus clouds are rain clouds of uniform grayness that extend over
        the entire sky.</p>

        <img src="h5.jpg" width="487" height="242">
        <p><b>Cumulonimbus clouds</b><br>
        <p>Cumulonimbus is the cloud formation resulting from a cumulus cloud
        building up, extending to great heights, and forming in the shape of an
        anvil. You can expect a thunderstorm if this cloud is moving in your
        direction.</p>

        <p><b>Cirrostratus clouds</b><br>
        <p>Cirrostratus is a fairly uniform layer of high stratus clouds that
        are darker than cirrus clouds. Cirrostratus clouds indicate good
        weather.</p>

        <p><b>Cirrocumulus clouds</b><br>
        <p>Cirrocumulus is a small, white, round cloud at a high altitude.
        Cirrocumulus clouds indicate good weather.</p>

        <p>A loose, vapory cloud (scud) driven before the wind is a sign of
        continuing bad weather.</p>

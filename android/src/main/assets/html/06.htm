    <p>Water is one of your most urgent needs in a survival situation. You can't
    live long without it, especially in hot areas where you lose water rapidly
    through perspiration. Even in cold areas, you need a minimum of 2 liters of
    water each day to maintain efficiency.</p>
    <p>More than three-fourths of your body is composed of fluids. Your body
    loses fluid because of heat, cold, stress, and exertion. To function
    effectively, you must replace the fluid your body loses. So, one of your
    first goals is to obtain an adequate supply of water.</p>
  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="par1">WATER SOURCES</a></h3>
<p>6-1. Almost any environment has water present to some degree. <a href="#fig6-1">Figure
6-1</a> lists possible sources of water in various environments. It also
provides information on how to make the water potable.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> If you do not have a canteen, cup, can, or other type of
container, improvise one from plastic or water-resistant cloth. Shape the
plastic or cloth into a bowl by pleating it. Use pins or other suitable
items—even your hands—to hold the pleats.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 6-1. Water Sources in Different Environments
(Continued)</b></p>
<p>6-2. If you do not have a reliable source to replenish your water supply,
stay alert for ways in which your environment can help you.</p>
<p><b>NOTE: DO NOT</b> substitute the fluids listed in <a href="#fig6-2">Figure
6-2</a> for water.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig6-2"></a><img height="252" alt="Figure 6-2. The Effects of Substitute Fluids" src="fig06-02.png" width="436"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 6-2. The Effects of Substitute Fluids</b></p>
<p>6-3. Heavy dew can provide water. Tie rags or tufts of fine grass around your
ankles and walk through dew-covered grass before sunrise. As the rags or grass
tufts absorb the dew, wring the water into a container. Repeat the process until
you have a supply of water or until the dew is gone. Australian natives
sometimes mop up as much as 1 liter an hour this way.</p>
<p>6-4. Bees or ants going into a hole in a tree may point to a water-filled
hole. Siphon the water with plastic tubing or scoop it up with an improvised
dipper. You can also stuff cloth in the hole to absorb the water and then wring
it from the cloth.</p>
<p>6-5. Water sometimes gathers in tree crotches or rock crevices. Use the above
procedures to get the water. In arid areas, bird droppings around a crack in the
rocks may indicate water in or near the crack.</p>
<p>6-6. Green bamboo thickets are an excellent source of fresh water. Water from
green bamboo is clear and odorless. To get the water, bend a green bamboo stalk,
tie it down, and cut off the top (<a href="#fig6-3">Figure 6-3</a>). The water
will drip freely during the night. Old, cracked bamboo may also contain water.</p>

<p>6-7. Wherever you find banana trees, plantain trees, or sugarcane, you can
get water. Cut down the tree, leaving about a 30-centimeter (12-inch) stump, and
scoop out the center of the stump so that the hollow is bowl-shaped. Water from
the roots will immediately start to fill the hollow. The first three fillings of
water will be bitter, but succeeding fillings will be palatable. The stump (<a href="#fig6-4">Figure
6-4</a>) will supply water for up to 4 days. Be sure to cover it to keep out
insects.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 6-4. Water From Plantain or Banana Tree Stump</b></p>
<p>6-8. Some tropical vines can give you water. Cut a notch in the vine as high
as you can reach, then cut the vine off close to the ground. Catch the dropping
liquid in a container or in your mouth (<a href="#fig6-5">Figure 6-5</a>).</p>

However, the milk from mature, brown, coconuts contains an oil that acts as a
laxative. Drink in moderation only.</p>

<p>6-10. In the American tropics you may find large trees whose branches support
air plants. These air plants may hold a considerable amount of rainwater in
their overlapping, thickly growing leaves. Strain the water through a cloth to
remove insects and debris.</p>
<p>6-11. You can get water from plants with moist pulpy centers. Cut off a
section of the plant and squeeze or smash the pulp so that the moisture runs
out. Catch the liquid in a container.</p>
<p>6-12. Plant roots may provide water. Dig or pry the roots out of the ground,
cut them into short pieces, and smash the pulp so that the moisture runs out.
Catch the liquid in a container.</p>
<p>6-13. Fleshy leaves, stems, or stalks, such as bamboo, contain water. Cut or
notch the stalks at the base of a joint to drain out the liquid.</p>
<p>6-14. The following trees can also provide water:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p><i>Palms.</i> The buri, coconut, sugar, rattan, and nips contain liquid.
    Bruise a lower frond and pull it down so the tree will &quot;bleed&quot; at
    the injury.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Traveler's tree.</i> Found in Madagascar, this tree has a cuplike
    sheath at the base of its leaves in which water collects.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Umbrella tree.</i> The leaf bases and roots of this tree of western
    tropical Africa can provide water.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Baobab tree.</i> This tree of the sandy plains of northern Australia
    and Africa collects water in its bottlelike trunk during the wet season.
    Frequently, you can find clear, fresh water in these trees after weeks of
    dry weather.</p>

<h3><a name="par2">STILL CONSTRUCTION</a></h3>
<p>6-15. You can use stills in various areas of the world. They draw moisture
from the ground and from plant material. You need certain materials to build a
still, and you need time to let it collect the water. It takes about 24 hours to
get 0.5 to 1 liter of water.</p>
<p><b>ABOVEGROUND STILLS</b></p>
<p>6-16. You can construct two types of aboveground stills. To make the <b>vegetation
bag still</b>, you need a sunny slope on which to place the still, a clear
plastic bag, green leafy vegetation, and a small rock (<a href="#fig6-6">Figure
6-6</a>).</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig6-6"></a><img height="245" alt="Figure 6-6. Vegetation Bag Still" src="fig06-06.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 6-6. Vegetation Bag Still</b></p>
<p>6-17. To make the still, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Fill the bag with air by turning the opening into the breeze or by
    &quot;scooping&quot; air into the bag.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Fill the plastic bag one-half to three-fourths full of green leafy
    vegetation. Be sure to remove all hard sticks or sharp spines that might
    puncture the bag.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place a small rock or similar item in the bag.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Close the bag and tie the mouth securely as close to the end of the bag
    as possible to keep the maximum amount of air space. If you have a piece of
    tubing, a small straw, or a hollow reed, insert one end in the mouth of the
    bag before you tie it securely. Then tie off or plug the tubing so that air
    will not escape. This tubing will allow you to drain out condensed water
    without untying the bag.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<center>
<table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="7" width="400" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td vAlign="top">
        <p align="center"><b>CAUTION</b></p>
        <p>Do not use poisonous vegetation. It will provide poisonous liquid.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Place the bag, mouth downhill, on a slope in full sunlight. Position the
    mouth of the bag slightly higher than the low point in the bag.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Settle the bag in place so that the rock works itself into the low point
    in the bag.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>6-18. To get the condensed water from the still, loosen the tie around the
bag's mouth and tip the bag so that the water collected around the rock will
drain out. Then retie the mouth securely and reposition the still to allow
further condensation.</p>
<p>6-19. Change the vegetation in the bag after extracting most of the water
from it. This will ensure maximum output of water.</p>
<p>6-20. Making a <b>transpiration bag still</b> is similar to the vegetation
bag, only easier. Simply tie the plastic bag over a leafy tree limb with a tube
inserted, and tie the mouth of the bag off tightly around the branch to form an
airtight seal. Tie the end of the limb so that it hangs below the level of the
mouth of the bag. The water will collect there (<a href="#fig6-7">Figure 6-7</a>).</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig6-7"></a><img height="193" alt="Figure 6-7. Water Transpiration Bag" src="fig06-07.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 6-7. Water Transpiration Bag</b></p>
<p>6-21. The same limb may be used for 3 to 5 days without causing long-term
harm to the limb. It will heal itself within a few hours of removing the bag.</p>
<p><b>BELOWGROUND STILL</b></p>
<p>6-22. To make a belowground still, you need a digging tool, a container, a
clear plastic sheet, a drinking tube, and a rock (<a href="#fig6-8">Figure 6-8</a>).</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig6-8"></a><img height="227" alt="Figure 6-8. Belowground Still" src="fig06-08.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 6-8. Belowground Still</b></p>
<p>6-23. Select a site where you believe the soil will contain moisture (such as
a dry streambed or a low spot where rainwater has collected). The soil at this
site should be easy to dig, and sunlight must hit the site most of the day.</p>
<p>6-24. To construct the still, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Dig a bowl-shaped hole about 1 meter (3 feet) across and 60 centimeters
    (24 inches) deep.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Dig a sump in the center of the hole. The sump's depth and perimeter will
    depend on the size of the container that you have to place in it. The bottom
    of the sump should allow the container to stand upright.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Anchor the tubing to the container's bottom by forming a loose overhand
    knot in the tubing.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place the container upright in the sump.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Extend the unanchored end of the tubing up, over, and beyond the lip of
    the hole.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place the plastic sheet over the hole, covering its edges with soil to
    hold it in place.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place a rock in the center of the plastic sheet.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Lower the plastic sheet into the hole until it is about 40 centimeters
    (16 inches) below ground level. It now forms an inverted cone with the rock
    at its apex. Make sure that the cone's apex is directly over your container.
    Also make sure the plastic cone does not touch the sides of the hole because
    the earth will absorb the condensed water.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Put more soil on the edges of the plastic to hold it securely in place
    and to prevent the loss of moisture.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Plug the tube when not in use to keep the moisture from evaporating and
    to keep insects out.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>6-25. You can drink water without disturbing the still by using the tube as a
straw. By opening the still, you release the moist, warm air that has
accumulated.</p>
<p>6-26. You may want to use plants in the hole as a moisture source. If so, dig
out additional soil from the sides of the hole to form a slope on which to place
the plants. Then proceed as above.</p>
<p>6-27. If polluted water is your only moisture source, dig a small trough
outside the hole about 25 centimeters (10 inches) from the still's lip (<a href="#fig6-9">Figure
6-9</a>). Dig the trough about 25 centimeters (10 inches) deep and 8 centimeters
(3 inches) wide. Pour the polluted water in the trough. Be sure you do not spill
any polluted water around the rim of the hole where the plastic sheet touches
the soil. The trough holds the polluted water and the soil filters it as the
still draws it. The water then condenses on the plastic and drains into the
container. This process works extremely well when your only water source is salt
water.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig6-9"></a><img height="218" alt="Figure 6-9. Belowground Still to Get Potable Water From Polluted Water" src="fig06-09.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 6-9. Belowground Still to Get Potable Water From
Polluted Water</b></p>
<p>6-28. You will need at least three stills to meet your individual daily water
intake needs. In comparison to the belowground still and the water transpiration
bag still, the vegetation bag produces the best yield of water.</p>
<h3><a name="par3">WATER PURIFICATION</a></h3>
<p>6-29. Rainwater collected in clean containers or in plants is usually safe
for drinking. However, purify water from lakes, ponds, swamps, springs, or
streams, especially the water near human settlements or in the tropics.</p>
<p>6-30. When possible, purify all water you get from vegetation or from the
ground by boiling or using iodine or chlorine. After purifying a canteen of
water, you must partially unscrew the cap and turn the canteen upside down to
rinse unpurified water from the threads of the canteen where your mouth touches.</p>
<p>6-31. Purify water by the following methods:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Use water purification tablets. (Follow the directions provided.)</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place 5 drops of 2 percent tincture of iodine in a canteen full of clear
    water. If the canteen is full of cloudy or cold water, use 10 drops. (Let
    the canteen of water stand for 30 minutes before drinking.)</p>
  <li>
    <p>Use 2 drops of 10 percent (military strength) povidone-iodine or 1
    percent titrated povidone-iodine. The civilian equivalent is usually 2
    percent strength, so 10 drops will be needed. Let stand for 30 minutes. If
    the water is cold and clear, wait 60 minutes. If it's very cold or cloudy,
    add 4 drops and wait 60 minutes.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place 2 drops of chlorine bleach (5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite) in a
    canteen of water. Let stand 30 minutes. If the water is cold or cloudy, wait
    60 minutes. Remember that not all bleach is the same around the world; check
    the available level of sodium hypochlorite.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Use potassium permanganate, commonly marketed as Condy's Crystals, for a
    number of applications, including emergency disinfection of water. The
    crystals are of a nonuniform size, so you must judge the actual dosage by
    the color of the water after adding the crystals. Add three small crystals
    to 1 liter (1 quart) of water. If the water turns a bright pink after
    waiting 30 minutes, the water is considered purified. If the water turns a
    dark pink, there is too much potassium permanganate to drink safely. Either
    add more water to dilute the mixture or save it for use as an antiseptic
    solution. If the water becomes a full red, like the color of cranberry
    juice, the solution may be used as an antifungal solution.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Boil your drinking water. This is the safest method of purifying your
    drinking water. By achieving a rolling boil, you can ensure that you are
    destroying all living waterborne pathogens.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>6-32. By drinking nonpotable water you may contract diseases or swallow
organisms that can harm you and may easily lead to potentially fatal waterborne
illnesses.</p>
<p>6-33. Two of the most prevalent pathogens found in most water sources
throughout the world are—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Giardia, which causes Giardiasis (beaver fever). It is characterized by
    an explosive, watery diarrhea accompanied by severe cramps lasting 7 to 14
    days.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Cryptosporidium, which causes Cryptosporidiosis. It is much like
    Giardiasis, only more severe and prolonged, and there is no known cure but
    time. Diarrhea may be mild and can last from 3 days to 2 weeks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The only effective means of neutralizing Cryptosporidium is by
boiling or by using a commercial microfilter or reverse-osmosis filtration
system. Chemical disinfectants such as iodine tablets or bleach have not shown
to be 100 percent effective in eliminating Cryptosporidium.</p>
<p>6-34. Examples of other diseases or organisms are—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p><i>Dysentery.</i> You may experience severe, prolonged diarrhea with
    bloody stools, fever, and weakness.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Cholera and typhoid.</i> You may be susceptible to these diseases
    regardless of inoculations. Cholera can cause profuse, watery diarrhea,
    vomiting, and leg cramps. Typhoid symptoms include fever, headache, loss of
    appetite, constipation, and bleeding in the bowel.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Hepatitis A. </i>Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, jaundice,
    and dark urine. This infection can spread through close person-to-person
    contact or ingestion of contaminated water or food.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Flukes. </i>Stagnant, polluted water—especially in tropical
    areas—often contains blood flukes. If you swallow flukes, they will bore
    into the bloodstream, live as parasites, and cause disease.</p>
  <li>
    <p><i>Leeches.</i> If you swallow a leech, it can hook onto the throat
    passage or inside the nose. It will suck blood, create a wound, and move to
    another area. Each bleeding wound may become infected.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="par4">WATER FILTRATION DEVICES</a></h3>
<p>6-35. If the water you find is also muddy, stagnant, and foul-smelling, you
can clear the water—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>By placing it in a container and letting it stand for 12 hours.</p>
  <li>
    <p>By pouring it through a filtering system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> These procedures only clear the water and make it more
palatable. You will have to purify it.</p>
<p>6-36. To make a filtering system, place several centimeters or layers of
filtering material such as sand, crushed rock, charcoal, or cloth in bamboo, a
hollow log, or an article of clothing (<a href="#fig6-10">Figure 6-10</a>).</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig6-10"></a><img height="196" alt="Figure 6-10. Water Filtering Systems" src="fig06-10.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 6-10. Water Filtering Systems</b></p>
<p>6-37. Remove the odor from water by adding charcoal from your fire. Charcoal
is also helpful in absorbing some agricultural and industrial chemicals. Let the
water stand for 45 minutes before drinking it.</p>
